<div><div>If their is any trouble that Telecom company, Africell is set to battle with this year, then it is local singer Richard Kaweesa.</div>
<div>The black yellow red singer has become a pain in the neck for the clement hill road located telecom company following his one man strikes at the premises for the second time running.</div>
<div>Workers woke up to head to offices on Monday morning only to find a self chained Kaweesa at the door steps with a placard reading: Arrest Africell Injustice.‚Äù</div>
<div>Kaweesa claims that the telecom while under names of Orange Uganda, used his song; Ani Akuba baby wange for commercial purposes but did not pay him any coin.</div>
<div>Kaweesa had earlier on camped at the offices but he did not get any attention with management claiming he has not rights to any payment.</div>
