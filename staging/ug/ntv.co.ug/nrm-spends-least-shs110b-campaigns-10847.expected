<div><p>The ruling party has spent an astronomical sum of money to fund its campaign outstripping the opposition by far as the cost is estimated at 110 billion shillings.</p>
<p>According to the report conducted by the Alliance for Election Campaign Finance Monitoring, a watchdog organisation, the report cites incidents of voter bribery, transporting voters to candidatesâ€™ rallies and money doled out to journalists who are covering presidential candidates.</p>
<p>However, the NRM deputy Secretary General Richard Todwong told NTV that the report is not backed by evidence.</p>
