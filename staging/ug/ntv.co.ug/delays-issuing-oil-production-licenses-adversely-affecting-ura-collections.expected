<div><p>The Uganda Revenue Authority says that the current state of affairs within the countryâ€™s oil and gas sector is negatively impacting Pay As You Earn and the Value Added Tax remittances.</p>
<p>Prior to the current hold back on the issuance of the key production licenses, the major players CNOOC, Tullow and TOTAL are believed to have invested a record $2.5 billion in exploration activities within the economy over the years.</p>
