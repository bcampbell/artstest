</span></header><div><p>Former NTV Be My Date show host, Anita ‘Fabiola’ Kyarimpa has dismissed rumours that had started to spread indicating that she was going to join Vision Group’s Urban TV.
</p>
<p>The capital FM presenter clarified via twitter that she will not be joining the Jinja road-based TV Station.</p>
<p>“I won’t be joining Urban TV. Thanks for the Love though,” she tweeted.
</p>
<p>What remains unanswered is what Anita was doing at Urban TV on Wednesday when she was spotted waiting to talk to one of the administrators; something which sparked off speculations that she could have been seeking to be employed at the station.
