Test suite for evaluating news article scrapers.


Freeform directory structure. Probably arrange by categories,
eg country, national papers, local papers, blogs, whatever.


original html:
data/blah/dailycheese.com/moon-made-of-cheese.html

expected data:
data/blah/dailycheese.com/moon-made-of-cheese.expected

TODO: maybe also have a .meta file, to store http headers to go along
with the html. html might not always be enough, eg character encoding,
languages...


The expected data files are designed to be easy to edit by hand.
They begin with a yaml front-matter section, then the rest
of the file is the text content that we expect to be extracted.
