artstest - a test suite for evaluating news article scrapers.

The idea is to build up a good set of test data for evaluating
news article scrapers, so any improvements can be quantified
and regressions easily flagged up.


USAGE:
 $ ./runtests [directory]


EXAMPLES:

 $ ./runtests

To run all tests

 $ ./runtests data/misc

to only run the tests in data/misc



TEST DATA:

data/ contains our main test suite. Ideally these should always
pass (still an aspirational goal ;- )

staging/ contains the stuff we want to be able to scrape, but
aren't quite ready for yet.

Under these top-level directories, the directory structure
is pretty freeform. Currently organised by country.

Each test has two files - one holding source data, the other
the expected result.

The source data is a .warc file capturing the raw http
response and (optionally) the request(s) and other metadata.

The test framework (runtests) goes like this:
  - for each .expected file
    - find the coressponding .warc file
    - run that though the scraper
    - compare the results against those in the .expected file

The .expected data files are designed to be easy to edit by hand.
They begin with a yaml front-matter section, then the rest
of the file is the content that we expect to be extracted.
The text can be plain text or html (tags will be stripped for
comparing).

an example .expected file:
---------------------------------------------------------
headline: Moon made of Cheese
urls:
    - http://dailycheese.com/moon-made-of-cheese.html
published: 2011-04-01
publication:
    site: dailycheese.com
    name: The Daily Cheese
---
Scientists today discovered...
blah 
blah
...NASA has no plans to send mice on future missions.
---------------------------------------------------------

The base filename for each test is unimportant, but it's good to have
something human readable (eg a slug).




Grabbing .warc files using wget
-------------------------------

wget >=1.14 supports outputing to warc files.

eg:

  $ wget --warc-file moon-made-of-cheese --no-warc-digests --no-warc-keep-log --no-warc-compression http://www.example.com/moon-made-of-cheese.html
