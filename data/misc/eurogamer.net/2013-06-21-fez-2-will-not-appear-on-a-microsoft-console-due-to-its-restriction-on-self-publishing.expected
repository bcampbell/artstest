<section><p>Fez developer Phil Fish has yet to announce which platforms he&#39;ll release the<a href="http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-06-13-polytron-announces-fez-2">recently announced Fez 2</a>on, but has stated that it won&#39;t be on Xbox.</p>

<p>When asked about potential platforms in an interview with<a href="http://www.polygon.com/2013/6/20/4445476/phil-fish-on-fez-2-ambition-and-launch-platforms-not-xbox" target="_blank">Polygon</a>, his answer was short and to the point: &#34;not Xbox.&#34;</p>
<p>His rationale for this is simple: Microsoft won&#39;t allow indie developers to self publish on Xbox One. &#34;I would develop for Xbone if they&#39;d let me, but they won&#39;t,&#34; the developer said on<a href="https://twitter.com/PHIL_FISH/status/347704234646568960" target="_blank">Twitter</a>.</p>
<p>&#34;I&#39;d love to release my games on every platform, but Microsoft is making it impossible for me to release on theirs. It&#39;s a shame,&#34; he<a href="https://twitter.com/PHIL_FISH/status/347706077539889154" target="_blank">added</a>.</p>
<p>When Polygon asked Fish if Microsoft&#39;s<a href="http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-06-19-microsoft-restores-game-ownership-and-expects-us-to-smile">recent change of heart about DRM</a>had swayed him, he replied, &#34;I don&#39;t think it changes much for me. They didn&#39;t change anything about their anti-indie policies.&#34;</p>
<p>Conversely, Fish seems pleased as punch about the PlayStation 4. &#34;PS4 seems to be doing everything right,&#34; he said. &#34;It&#39;s too early to tell how everything is going to unfold but their heart definitely seems to be in the right place.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;With Microsoft they&#39;ve made it painfully clear they don&#39;t want my ilk on their platform. I can&#39;t even self-publish there. Whereas on PS4, I can. It&#39;s that simple.&#34;</p>
<p>This would not be the first time Fish has spoken out against Microsoft, as he criticised the corporation last year when it<a href="http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-07-19-save-corrupting-fez-patch-back-online">didn&#39;t allow him to patch Fez without exorbitant fees</a>. Though Fish has since said on<a href="https://twitter.com/PHIL_FISH/status/347704234646568960" target="_blank">Twitter</a>that the year-old patch ordeal is &#34;irrelevant to the [current] situation.&#34;</p>
<p>I&#39;ve asked Fish if he would reconsider his stance if Microsoft were to reconsider its self-publishing policies. I&#39;m currently awaiting reply and will update if I hear anything.</p>
<p>Fez&#39;s upcoming sequel is still shrouded in mystery, but Fish stated to Polygon, &#34;Fez 2 is to Fez 1 what Zelda 2 was to Zelda 1, but more different.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;The biggest reason is that I just wanted to go back to that world. I want to expand on my little world and its mythology. It&#39;s not a case of wanting to recycle ideas we didn&#39;t get to put in Fez 1. Since the games are going to be so different, there&#39;s not a whole lot that could just carry over.&#34;</p>
<p>In other Fez news, Fish<a href="https://twitter.com/PHIL_FISH/status/347769076682203139" target="_blank">tweeted</a>that the Ouya port of the first game is &#34;coming along nicely.&#34;</p>
