<div><p>BOTH sides of the <a href="http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/independence-referendum-eu-chief-says-4155444">independence campaign yesterday</a> insisted that everything is going according to plan. But only the Yes camp can celebrate a poll showing just a six point gap.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/independence-referendum-need-facts-weigh-4155342">With 15 days to go until the vote</a>, the poll showed 53 per cent for No and 47 per cent to Yes.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/jim-murphy-claims-noisy-tap-4152513">The No camp</a> expected a tightening of the gap – but not to this extent.</p>
<p>“Yikes!” was the cartoon reaction of one well-placed No campaigner.</p>
<p>Try explaining what is going on and pundits talk about voter churn from the second televised debate and NHS scaremongering.</p>
<p>But there is another factor at play. The tangible sense of excitement as the referendum campaign comes to life has fed into <br/>
the Yes vote.           </p>
<p></p>

<p>Most people have had enough of the campaign and their minds are made up.</p>
<p>But other voters are just waking up to what is going on.</p>
<p>An SNP source said: “That sense of excitement, anticipation and being caught up in history takes you logically to a Yes vote.</p>
<p>“If you vote No, it is essentially a vote for tomorrow being the same as yesterday.</p>
<p>“If you reach this level of excitement, you will feel you want to continue it with your vote.”</p>
<p>Building a sense of tense anticipation is what the Yes campaign want now – hence the induced euphoria surrounding <br/>
Alex Salmond’s Dundee walkabout yesterday.           </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Look for more “nation-on-the-edge-of-its-seat” action over the next two weeks. The Yes insider added: “We always thought the excitement of the short campaign would benefit us.”</p>
<p>The No camp can hardly be said to be excited.</p>
<p>There is no panic, they insist, not even if the gap is down to six points from a 22-point lead just a month ago.</p>
<p>According to the No voting experts, a tightening in the polls was expected.</p>
<p>Alistair Darling always said the vote would “go down to the wire”.</p>
<p>The No experts say they are still confident because undecided voters who are likely to vote Yes, led by the emotional appeal, have declared earlier.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Those who are likely to vote No, led by the head or the wallet, will plump for that at the last minute.</p>
<p>But No would rather be entering the short campaign with clear water between them and the SNP.</p>
<p>Their tactics now are to emphasise the big devolution offer of staying in the UK and to stress what is at risk.</p>
<p>Most people think they will be worse off under independence. The No campaign will deliver that message in a way that comes down to pounds and pence and not just abstractions.</p>
<p>Every day until the vote, Darling will pummel the point about what currency a separate Scotland would use. It is the most basic question and, still, there is no certain answer.</p>
<p>Look out for the “risk” message being delivered on issues including your weekly shop, power bills, mortgages and loans.</p>
<p>There will also be an appeal to Labour voters.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Archie Macpherson’s storming remarks in support of the Union hit an emotional register that the No camp have missed so far.</p>
<p>That is a cue for Gordon Brown to enter with the kind of methodist central hall appeal to Labour values.</p>
<p>Expect to hear voices including former defence secretary John Reid.</p>
<p>Yes reckon they have fought No to a draw on the economy, that the idea of Scotland being a successful country is embedded and there is all to play for.</p>
<p>The No camp counter that tightening polls sharpen minds and galvanise their support.</p>
<p>It is now down to who can motivate their followers best and appeal to the crucial undecided voters.</p>
