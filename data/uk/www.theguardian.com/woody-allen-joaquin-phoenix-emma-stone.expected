<div><p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/woodyallen">Woody Allen</a>muse-watch has gone into overdrive with the news –<a href="http://variety.com/2014/film/news/emma-stone-joaquin-phoenix-woody-allen-1201172304/">broken by Variety</a>– that<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/emma-stone">Emma Stone</a>has signed on for a new Woody Allen movie. Stone is also the star of Allen&#39;s<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jan/10/woody-allen-magic-in-moonlight-comedy">Magic in the Moonlight</a>, a 20s set romance featuring Colin Firth, which is due for release later this year.</p>
<p>Details about the plot, period and supporting cast of WASP 2014 – all Allen&#39;s shoots have the working title Woody Allen Summer Project – remain thin on the ground, but Allen is expected to write, produce and direct.</p>
<p>Phoenix is an Allen first-timer but Stone coming back for seconds suggests she may follow in the footsteps of<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/scarlettjohansson">Scarlett Johansson</a>,<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/diane-keaton">Diane Keaton</a>and<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/mia-farrow">Mia Farrow</a>as Allen&#39;s female lead of choice. The director has also worked frequently with<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/16/hannah-sisters-romance">Dianne Wiest</a>and<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/apr/25/judy-davis-never-wanted-celebrity-interview">Judy Davis</a>; earlier this year<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/cate-blanchett">Cate Blanchett</a>won an Oscar for<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/her">her</a>role as a vengeful socialite in<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/blue-jasmine">Blue Jasmine</a>.</p>
<p>Stone&#39;s new film,<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/the-amazing-spider-man-2">The Amazing Spider-Man 2</a>, has just opened big in the US. Phoenix&#39;s next off the blocks<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/inherent-vice">Inherent Vice</a>, an adaptation of the Thomas Pynchon novel by The Master director Paul Thomas Anderson.</p>
<p>Allen himself is also front of camera for the first time in a decade in<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/fading-gigolo">Fading Gigolo</a>, John Turturro&#39;s comedy romance about a florist who turns to male prostitution. In<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/may/03/diane-keaton-i-love-woody-allen-i-believe-my-friend">an interview with the Guardian over the weekend</a>, Keaton joined a chorus of colleagues defending Allen following an open letter from adopted daughter Dylan Farrow revisiting abuse claims from which Allen was cleared in the mid 1990s.</p>
