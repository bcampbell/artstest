<div><p>A TERROR attack in the UK is “highly likely” following the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/1503398/isis-terror-two-knife-attackers-beheaded-priest-two-nuns-taken-prisoner-by-knife-attackers-in-french-church-rouvray-rouen-hostage-attack-filmed-by-terrorists/">recent atrocities in Europe</a>, security services have warned.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, it was revealed that authorities have disrupted seven plots in the UK in the last 18 months.</p>

<p>Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley said Scotland Yard is “constantly testing” the preparedness to respond to an attack.</p>
<p>However, security agency MI5, which sets the threat level, says the risk to Brits has developed significantly in wake of the attacks in Europe.</p>
<p>In the last month alone ISIS has claimed responsibility for <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/1487396/isis-releases-chilling-video-explaining-exactly-how-nice-killer-used-terror-truck-during-massacre-then-threatens-a-similar-attack-in-the-uk/">brutalities in Nice</a>, where 84 people were killed, a <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/1501631/germany-isis-suicide-bomb-nut-blew-himself-up-at-ansbach-bar-after-being-turned-away-from-festival-filled-with-thousands-of-revellers/">suicide bombing in Ansbach</a> and <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/1465260/group-hails-boy-fighter-as-police-find-isis-flag-in-his-room-after-the-afghan-refugee-severely-injured-four-in-train-attack-that-left-carriage-looking-like-a-slaughterhouse/">an axe attack on a train near Wurzburg </a>in southern Germany.</p>
<p>Today <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/1504518/rouen-saint-etienne-du-rouvray-isis-1504518/">two ISIS attackers stormed a church</a> near Rouen, Normandy, and slit a French priest’s throat after taking nuns and worshippers hostage.</p>
<p>Britain’s intelligence agencies highlighted the seriousness of the threat as they defended themselves against accusations of collecting UK citizens’ personal information without proper legal safeguards put in place.</p>
<p>The charity Privacy International has taken the issue before the Investigatory Powers Tribunal (IPT) in London in a hearing expected to last four days.</p>

		Threat level in the UK is set as ‘severe’, security services say </figcaption></figure><p>Thomas de la Mare QC, for the charity, told the tribunal there was no form of “red flag system” in place to protect the privacy of UK citizens from the “aggressive use” of data collection powers given to the security services under section 94 of the Telecommunications Act 1984.</p>
<p>The accusations are being fought by the Foreign Secretary, Home Secretary, MI6, MI5 and Government Communication Headquarters (GCHQ).</p>
<p>James Eadie QC, for the security services, is arguing that section 94 powers have at all times been used lawfully as an “essential tool” to meet the “increasing” terrorist threat.</p>

<p>He states the principal threat comes from militant Islamist extremists, as was more than apparent from the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/1505199/french-church-murderer-was-convicted-terrorist-allowed-out-unsupervised-while-wearing-electronic-tag/">recent tragic terrorist attacks</a> in Tunisia, Paris and Brussels.</p>
<p>He says Northern Ireland-related terrorism also remains a severe threat.</p>
<p>Privacy International says current secret government surveillance practices go beyond what was revealed in the case of whistle-blower Edward Snowden.</p>

<p>Bulk personal data includes information extracted from passports, travel records, financial data, telephone calls and emails.</p>
