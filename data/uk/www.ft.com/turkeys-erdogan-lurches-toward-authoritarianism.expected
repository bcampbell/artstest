</div>
<p>Surveying a throng of supporters in Ankara after the latest in an unbroken sweep of election victories, prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan also looked out on a<a href="http://www.ft.com/Turkey">Turkey</a>that has gone through the most turbulent of years.</p>
<p>Since May 2013, the country has been damaged by an emerging markets rout, mass protests against the prime minister, a corruption probe, a split with an old government ally, a torrent of hostile leaks, and<a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/ceb93554-cebc-11e3-8e62-00144feabdc0.html">bans on Twitter and YouTube</a>.</p>
<p>The past 12 months have seen<a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/1543ee04-cc99-11e3-ab99-00144feabdc0.html">Mr Erdogan’s rule</a>increasingly described as authoritarian, the vulnerability of the economy much commented on, and the rule of law – an issue that affects both the political and economic spheres – often seen as under threat.</p>
<p>Despite it all, local elections delivered the triumph he savoured from his Ankara balcony on March 30, a victory convincing enough to put the presidency of the country within his grasp should he decide to run in inaugural elections to the post in August.</p>
<p>“The people have given a clear message to Turkey and the world,” Mr Erdogan said that night. “The people will not bow and Turkey is invincible.”</p>
<p>Mr Erdogan’s election success shows that his stock of capital with his core supporters is still high. His government is feted for improving services, notably health and housing, and for ending restrictions that constricted the lives of millions of people in Turkey’s pious heartlands – especially headscarf-wearing women.</p>
<p>But the capital that Turkey built up on the<a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/12a5e260-cc99-11e3-ab99-00144feabdc0.html">international stage</a>– chiefly through political and economic reforms that reached a high point between an International Monetary Fund-led bailout in 2001 and the start of EU membership talks in 2005 – is running low.</p>
<p>Rarely in recent years has the country appeared more isolated, criticised by its allies in the EU and US over<a href="http://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/humanrightsreport/#wrapper">freedom of expression</a>, the use of force and the rule of law. Meanwhile growth, widely forecast to be between 2 and 3 per cent this year, is far from the sky-high rates of the start of the decade. Both the<a href="http://www.imf.org/External/Pubs/FT/GFSR/2013/02/index.htm">IMF</a>and the<a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/mpr_20140211_part1.htm">US Federal Reserve</a>have called Turkey the most vulnerable big emerging market, largely because of its<a href="http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/0b9b66bc-cc98-11e3-ab99-00144feabdc0.html">reliance on debt to fuel the economy</a>.</p>
<p>According to Turkey’s central bank, the country’s large current account deficit is principally underwritten by bonds and loans rather than<a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/11b3ecf4-cc98-11e3-ab99-00144feabdc0.html">foreign direct investment</a>. The mainstay of the economy is not exports but<a href="http://www.tcmb.gov.tr/yeni/eng/">domestic demand</a>, which has been propelled by annual credit growth of between 20 and 30 per cent for most of the past five years.</p>
<p>While the government has greatly improved its finances, companies’ net<a href="http://www.tcmb.gov.tr/yeni/dovizpozisyon/FEALNFC2014-01.pdf">foreign exchange liabilities</a>have soared during Mr Erdogan’s time in office – from $6.5bn in 2002 to more than $170bn today. By contrast, the central bank’s net reserves are only around $32bn; the bank’s independence from the prime minister has been questioned despite a rate rise that rallied markets this spring.</p>
<p>The question now facing Turkey is whether Mr Erdogan will continue his steady accumulation of power and keep the country on its current political and economic path. His supporters say he has little option in the face of an alleged conspiracy by the movement of<a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0e7a3854-cc98-11e3-ab99-00144feabdc0.html">Fethullah Gulen</a>, an ally-turned-foe with followers throughout Turkish institutions. The prime minister blames Mr Gulen for the corruption probe, which he depicts as an anti-government plot.</p>
<p>“Call Erdogan an autocrat and then you don’t need to talk about coup attempts, illegal wiretappings, parallel structures, shadowy connections, espionage, and the misuse of judicial powers,”<a href="http://www.dailysabah.com/columns/ibrahim-kalin/2014/04/16/authoritarian-fantasies">wrote Ibrahim Kalin</a>, one of the prime minister’s top advisers, in a recent column.</p>
<p>“Calling Erdogan a dictator is an insult to Turkish democracy and the Turkish people. But nobody cares; this is the new fashion and it sells.”</p>
<p>Such protestations have not convinced everybody. In a speech before a glowering Mr Erdogan last month, Hasim Kilic, the head of the country’s constitutional court, declared that current trends would “bring about the end of the state of law”.</p>
<p>Thousands of police and hundreds of prosecutors and judges have been moved from their positions since the corruption investigation began in late December. A new law has increased the government’s power over the judiciary, even though key provisions were thrown out by the constitutional court. The court also found Mr Erdogan’s ban on Twitter, which the government previously maintained in defiance of an order by a lower tribunal, to be without legal basis.</p>
<p>The debate on the rule of law – and the fight with the Gulenists – affects corporate life too. Groups associated with Mr Gulen or with Turkey’s old secular order have been subjected to revoked licences, cancelled deals and high-profile tax raids.</p>
<p>In one instance, Turkish Airlines led a series of creditors in pulling money out of a Gulenist bank – while the largely stalled corruption probe targeted government-connected companies, whose executives deny any wrongdoing.</p>
<p>“To attract local and foreign investment, we need the rule of law,” says Suzan Sabanci Dincer, chairman of Akbank, one of Turkey’s biggest banks.</p>
<p>Ali Babacan, deputy prime minister, has highlighted similar concerns. “If we cannot be law-governed, our democracy will remain incomplete and our economy will not reach the point we wish,” he said in a recent speech.</p>
<p>“We reached $10,000 per capita income in 2007-08, but . . . we have started to have problems even in rising from $10,000 to $11,000,” he continued. “We need to have equal opportunity within competition for all our companies . . . There should be no tolerance in fighting corruption.”</p>
<p>The issue is all the more pressing, as Turkey vies for a higher place on the value chain, now the era of easy international credit may be over.</p>
<p>The country, often hailed for its favourable demographics, has the highest proportion of 15-29-year-olds neither employed nor in<a href="http://www.oecd.org/edu/Turkey_EAG2013%20Country%20Note.pdf">education or training in the OECD</a>, at 35 per cent, against an average of 16 per cent. Such educational characteristics are reflected in the economy: high technology goods are 2 per cent of<a href="http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2013/cr13364.pdf">manufactured exports</a>, a lower figure than a decade ago and<a href="http://wdi.worldbank.org/table/5.13">far below</a>Poland, Mexico, South Africa and Russia.</p>
<p>Mr Erdogan’s supporters emphasise the broader picture. The prime minister has done more than any previous leader, for example, to resolve the country’s Kurdish conflict, its bloodiest dispute. Indeed, the 6 per cent bloc of votes that go to pro-Kurdish parties could be instrumental in making him president.</p>
<p>On foreign policy, too, Mr Erdogan retains the capacity to break the mould: in a historic step in late April he issued his condolences over the mass killings of Armenians almost 100 years ago.</p>
<p>Yigit Bulut, another prominent prime ministerial adviser, has argued there are only two great leaders in the world today: Mr Erdogan and Russia’s Vladimir Putin.</p>
<p>Turkey is, of course, far from Russian-style authoritarianism. But if it goes further down the road it is travelling, the political and economic results could be felt for years to come.</p>
