<div property="dc:description"><p>Nothing smells better than baked bread and it’s a living thing and it’s not often that you get to work with living things in a kitchen.</p>
<p>Our bread is magical. We don’t make white or brown bread, we make cakey, hot cross bun bread. It’s more like a museli bread, two bites are never the same.</p>
<noscript><p>
	It makes the most fantastic toast: big, thick and brilliant with a bit of butter. It also makes fantastic Welsh rarebit and, best of all, our bread matures for a day or two and becomes like Dundee cake so you never lose anything.</p>

<p>
	Any that&rsquo;s leftover after two or three days can be dried out, slice wafer thin and serve with soft cheese for a tasty treat.</p>

<p>
	It&rsquo;s a bread that you can use all year round and it&rsquo;s a big part of what we do, it&rsquo;s an extension of our food, it&rsquo;s that important.</p>

<p>
	However, I have no idea how to make it. In my experience, I have found that only certain people can make bread. You have to have a feel for it in your hands and in your heart. That&rsquo;s the way nature intended it to be: a magical thing for magical people.</p>

<p>
	Our magical person is Kate Johnston and here&rsquo;s her recipe for making our Michelin star bread.</p>

<p>
	Give it a go, it&rsquo;s expensive to make but it&rsquo;s a treat for everyone.</p>

<p>
<u><strong>21212&rsquo;s Michelin star bread</strong></u></p>

<p>
<em>3 pounds of bread flour (we use P55 but you can use any)</em></p>

<p>
<em>125g of butter</em></p>

<p>
<em>50g of yeast</em></p>

<p>
<em>A pint of water (tepid)</em></p>

<p>
<em>A tablespoon of sugar</em></p>

<p>
<em>2 tablespoons of water</em></p>

<p>
<em><strong>1 </strong>Mix the flour, butter, salt and sugar together in a mixing bowl</em></p>

<p>
<em><strong>2</strong> Add the yeast to the water in a separate bowl</em></p>

<p>
<em><strong>3 </strong>Add the yeast water to the flour mixture and mix together</em></p>

<p>
<em><strong>4</strong> At this stage you can add anything you want to the bread to flavour it. We usually add either a tablespoon of curry powder, 2 handfuls of sultanas, caraway seeds or pumpkin seeds but you can put whatever you want in.</em></p>

<p>
<em><strong>5</strong> Kneed the mixture for 7-10 minutes until you&rsquo;re left with a smooth dough.</em></p>

<p>
<em><strong>6 </strong>Put the dough in a bowl and leave in a warm place to double in size (prove).</em></p>

<p>
<em><strong>7 </strong>Roll the dough into either four loaves or however many small buns you want.</em></p>

<p>
<em><strong>8</strong> Egg wash the dough, add some garlic, onion and cheese to the top and dust with some flour and paprika.</em></p>

<p>
<em><strong>9</strong> Leave the dough to prove again.</em></p>

<p>
<em><strong>10 </strong>Cook the loaves for 25 minutes at 190 degrees centigrade. If you are making buns, cook them for around 10 minutes at 190 degrees centigrade.</em></p>

<p>
	This recipe makes four loaves.</p>

<em>Bread comes in a variety of different styles and flavours, from sourdough to pumpernickel, but did you know that in Britain 70% of the bread eaten is white?</em></p>

<p>
<em>Here are 10 more fascinating facts that you might not know about bread.</em></p>

<p>
<em><strong>1</strong> The colour of the twist tie/tab on bread packaging indicates what day it was baked on.</em></p>

<p>
<em><strong>2</strong> Pre-sliced bread was invented in America by Otto Rohwedder in 1928. Rohwedder had spent 16 years working on his invention, which many assumed would be a passing fad because of concerns that it would go stale faster than unsliced bread.</em></p>

<p>
<em><strong>3</strong> Pre-sliced bread was banned in America in January 1943 by Claude R Wickard, head of the War Foods Administration and Secretary of Agriculture. It is believed the ban was introduced to help preserve resources and conserve wax paper. It was lifted almost three months later.</em></p>

<p>
<em><strong>4</strong> In Western Europe in Medieval times breads were named after the class of people who ate them. Examples include knight&rsquo;s loaf, squire&rsquo;s loaf and Pope&rsquo;s loaf.</em></p>

<p>
<em><strong>5</strong> The toaster was actually invented in 1926, two years before sliced bread.</em></p>

<p>
<em><strong>6 </strong>It takes nine seconds for a combine harvester to harvest enough wheat to make about 70 loaves of bread.</em></p>

<p>
<em><strong>7 </strong>Napoleon is credited with giving pumpernickel bread its name. During the Prussian campaign, Napoleon demanded a loaf of dark rye bread for his horse, ordering &ldquo;pain pue Nicole&rdquo;. However, to Germanic ears the order sounded like &lsquo;pumpernickel&rsquo;, which is now the term used for the bread.</em></p>

<p>
<em><strong>8 </strong>The inner part of the bread encased by the crust is called the crumb, hence why small bits of bread are called crumbs.</em></p>

<p>
<em><strong>9</strong> Bread is believed to have been invented by the Egyptians around 8.000 BC. It was used as a form of currency and was so important that loeaves were often placed in tombs for the deceased to take to the afterlife.</em></p>

<p>
<em><strong>10</strong> The average slice of packaged bread contains 1 gram of fat and 75 to 80 calories.</em></p>
