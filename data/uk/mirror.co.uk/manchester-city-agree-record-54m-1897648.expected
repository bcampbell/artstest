<div><p>Radamel Falcao will become Manchester City’s first signing of the Manuel Pellegrini era after<a href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester%20city%20transfer%20news" target="_blank">the Etihad club</a>agreed a British record transfer fee for the Atletico Madrid striker, writes<a href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/the%20people">the Sunday People.</a></p>
<p>City have met the £54million buy-out clause in the Colombian’s Atletico contract –<a href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/chelsea-owner-roman-abramovich-arranges-1870463" target="_blank">to snatch him away from incoming Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho.</a></p>
<p>Falcao, has long been one of hottest properties in world football and his signing by City will be a boost for the profile of the Premier League.</p>
<p>The deal is also a major coup for Pellegrini, with 27-year-old Falcao keen to work for the Chilean, who is<a href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/next-manchester-city-manager-manuel-1890358" target="_blank">expected to sign a two-year deal at City within a fortnight</a>.</p>
<p>Mourinho and Falcao share an agent, Jorge Mendes, and the Special One was hoping Falcao would join him at Chelsea.</p>

<p>But the player is said to prefer City rather than<a href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/chelsea-transfers-fernando-torres-insists-1896671" target="_blank">go head-to-head with Fernando Torres,</a>the favourite of owner Roman Abramovich, at Stamford Bridge.</p>
<p>His transfer fee will surpass the £50m Chelsea paid Liverpool for Torres in 2011.</p>
<p>Falcao’s imminent arrival, on a deal worth more than £200,000 per week, means<a href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/manchester-city-transfers-carlos-tevez-1888913" target="_blank">Carlos Tevez will be allowed to leave City</a>– and the Argentine has offers on the table from wealthy French clubs Paris Saint-Germain and Monaco.</p>
<p>Falcao will now link up at the Etihad with Sergio Aguero, the man he replaced at Atletico in 2011.</p>
<p>Aguero was one of several City players disenchanted with life under former boss Roberto Mancini.</p>
<p>Edin Dzeko may also leave City this summer but a proposed part-exchange deal involving the Bosnian and Falcao is not believed to interest Atletico.</p>
