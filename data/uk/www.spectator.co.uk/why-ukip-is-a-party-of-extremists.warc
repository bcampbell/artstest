<p>				Last Saturday I wrote for my newspaper a column whose drift was that it was time for the sane majority of the Conservative party to repel those elements on the Tory right who plainly wish the Prime Minister and the coalition ill, and who would never be satisfied with his stance on Europe, however much he tried to adjust it to please them. I dealt at some length with Ukip, explaining why I and many like me would never support a Conservative candidate who made any kind of a deal with these people. The same went (I said) for the party nationally: ‘I will never support a Conservative party that has made any kind of national agreement with Ukip. Blackmailed by extremists, it could be blackmailed again.’</p>
<p>A friend (we’ll call him Ronald) sent me a courteous email in response, ending: ‘What btw do you think are Ukip’s “extremist” views?’</p>
<p>I mulled over Ronald’s question; then, after reading every one of the responses already posted beneath my column, many of them from Ukip supporters to Tories who were contemplating defecting to Ukip, I replied. This is what I wrote:</p>
<p><i>Been giving this much thought.</i></p>
<p><i>It’s an important question. Reflecting on my choice of the word ‘extremist’ I reflect that I wrote it without pondering its applicability. It came naturally to me as I pictured the party I was describing.</i></p>
<p><i>Why? I’ve just spent a (for me) affirming hour reading the online comments beneath my column, from more than 100 predominantly Ukip-sympathising readers. Affirming because they’re just as extreme as I’d assumed.</i></p>

<p><i>Seeking ammunition in the first category, I could wade through our readers’ comments, or through statements from Ukip candidates or the (much more careful) public words of Nigel Farage, or scrutinise Ukip’s lunatic 2010 manifesto, and doubtless come up with a selection of fairly extreme utterances. But the truth is that you could do this with any party. In pursuit of more than point-scoring quotes, one inquires instead into what seems to be the spirit of a movement.</i></p><div class="middle-promo widget_advert">				<div class="widget_advert_content" style="min-height: auto; width: 100%;"><!--JavaScript Tag // Tag for network 903: The Spectator Ltd // Website: Spectator // Page: Features // Placement: Features-Top-728 x 90 (5078671) // created at: Apr 8, 2014 2:16:54 PM-->&#13;

<p><i>The spirit of Ukippery is paranoid. It distorts and simplifies the world, perceiving a range of different ills and difficulties as all proceeding from two sources: foreigners abroad, and in Britain a ‘metropolitan liberal elite’ (typically thought to be in league with foreigners). None of the problems it identifies (with immigration, with EU bureaucracy, with the cost of the EU, with the ambitions of some Europeanists, with political correctness, with health-and-safety, with human rights legislation etc) are anything less than real; but to the un-extremist mind they need to be tackled ad hoc, one by one, rather than seen as the hydra-headed expression of a single monster.</i></p>
<p><i>Very well, you ask, if immigration/foreigners/Brussels are not the overwhelming cause of the problems of modern Britain, what is? I would reply that there is no overwhelming cause, but many: some insoluble. I’d number among these a general decadence arising from nearly 70 years of peace, security and rising incomes. The uncompetitiveness that renders us easy prey for the manufactories of, not Europe, but China and the developing world; the levels of welfare provision that rob indigenous Britons of hunger to work (not the poor immigrants who then take the work)… but this analysis lays many of our problems at the door of many of the voters attracted to Ukip, and is of less interest to the party.</i></p>
<p><i>It is the single-cause, single-prism, single-root-explanation way of interpreting the world and its sorrows (a way of thinking and seeing that has its attraction to all human beings) that leads to (or is the fount of) extremism: it is one of the reasons religion, with its forces-of-evil focus, has so often led people that way.</i></p>
<p><i>You could have asked me, in the heyday of McCarthyism, to tell you what was extremist about the senator’s campaign to root out communist influences. You could have asked me during the witch hunts of Salem to tell you what was extremist about identifying agents of evil among us. And in reply I could have looked for crazy utterances or promises. But were I being more thoughtful I would instead have recommended the analysis above.<br/>
Best,<br/>
Matt</i></p>
<p>With the benefit of hindsight and a little more time I could add to that at some length, but I’ll limit myself to this. There are now more than 400 comments posted online, which for the <i>Times </i>(to which one must subscribe in order to comment) is a lot. I’ve read them all and with some attention. The bulk are from Ukip sympathisers — and forgive me for observing that if they are subscribers to an intelligent national quality newspaper then most will not be from that tiny minority of citizens in need of psychiatric help. They are ordinary men and women who have become gripped by an ideology with a holistic world view.</p>
<p>From their comments, two sets of words and phrases stand out. The first is that bugbear I identified in my email to Ronald: all or any of the words ‘liberal’, ‘metropolitan’, and ‘elite’. This idea that there is a conspiracy of the privileged to cheat and oppress the masses, forcing them beneath a yoke in which alien agencies are involved, leaps from any study not only of Marxism but (on the right) of Poujadism and Peronism.</p>
<p>The other bugbear is, of course, the EU. But it is the terms in which that irritating, smug and silly organisation is described, that startle me. ‘Tyranny’ is a favourite word among my Ukip (and right-wing Tory) assailants. Read the posts. These people really have been persuaded that they are living under a tyranny in the full sense of that word. They describe the EU as though its methods, its despotism and its oppression of them and their daily lives were barely distinguishable from those of the Soviet Union. They believe this.</p>
<p>To a world seen through this prism, extreme measures are the only appropriate response. The Conservative party should have absolutely nothing to do with it.</p>

<p>For decades the three major parties have totally ignored the electorate’s genuine concerns on immigration. They have tiptoed around the subject and not one of them has had the cojones to grasp the nettle.</p>
<p>Now UKIP has finally stepped in and mentioned the unmentionable, and all hell has broken loose. How can you expect anything other than extremist views to emerge in this circumstance? The pressure has been building up for decades, because the electorate has been totally ignored on this issue.</p>
<p>Our country has been ruled by the EU, think tanks, focus groups, quangos, in fact, everyone is having a say in how our ‘democracy’ is run, except us &#8211; Joe Public. Now this is starting to change and the Establishment clearly doesn’t like it. In short, Matthew, I think you should be arguing on our side, rather than theirs.</p>

Seeing as UKIP was opposed to membership of the EU, I decided to take another look at its policies. The EU, as presently constituted, is corrupt and unaccountable, and should be reformed radically, or we should leave it. It was good to see a political party taking an unequivocal stand on this. Then I looked at the other policies. Immigration? UKIP is against immigration. But Britain is a nation of immigrants, and has always relied on them as sources of fresh labour and ideas. Windmills? How can these be a blot on Britain&#8217;s pastoral idyll, when the landscape of Britain has been intensively managed for more than 1000 years? Gay Marriage? How can a party that claims to be libertarian ban gay marriage? I don&#8217;t give two hoots about gay marriage &#8211; but I do care that a party that markets itself as libertarian holds to a draconian policy that puts politics in the bedroom, where it doesn&#8217;t belong. Basically, UKIP is a party of small, frightened, little people, who are terrified of the OTHER &#8211; of anything that differs from their cosy little selves? Nigel Farage? More like Hyacinth Bucket (pronounced Bouquet).</p>

distinction is important. A wind turbine is not a windmill. That,<br />

how democracy is regarded by politicians. If you were to ponder that<br />

their opinions. Those who support it appear to be considerably more<br />

Fear of a new political age where the electorate is far less predictable. where the electorate is beginning to think for itself, where Cameron&#8217;s ersatz  brand of Conservatism is destroyed forever and any long term hope that the UK will settle for anything like, the current arrangements with Europe, is also gone, for ever.</p>
<p>There will be more and more vitriolic and personal attacks against UKIP and those who might support it. Self defeating of course, but the fear causes the irrational response</p>
<p>2014 will shake all the main political parties. There will be a landslide win by UKIP.</p>
<p>The likes of Parris, will be flattened  in this new age and will cease to have any relevance whatsoever. Nobody is listening to him any more.</p>
<p>Cameron has done this himself, it is his fault, (assisted ably by Gideon).</p>

<p>Frankly, Mr. Gee I am becoming just a little bit cheesed off with this lie &#8211; and lie it is!  Up until the early fifties the only immigrants to enter Britain were Huegenots from France escaping religious persecution and German and Austrian jews in the thirties. And, just for the record, not one of these groups demanded that we ditch our ways and adopt the genuinely inferior cultures brought to our shores by unwanted and unneccessary Johnny-come-latelys. I do not think that an apology for this would be unwarranted! I am not accusing you personally of deliberately lying, but you are repeating this&#8230;lie!</p>

It is something much narrower too than Poujadism or Peronism. </p>
<p>The most significant uniting factor behind UKIP&#8217;s appeal, which finds common cause among its disparate supporters is immigration, and in particular, the scale of immigration. Antipathy to that is the galvanising force drawing significant new support from many on the left as well as right. The mainstream parties have immigration policies, which a sizeable minority of the electorate vigorously oppose, or regard as inadequate. Until the Conservative party, in particular, is seen to address the issue more effectively (and fairly), UKIP will remain a thorn in their side, potentially depriving them of power after 2015. At present, a weak and divided Labour leadership is failing to capitalise on Conservative divisions. By 2015, that may change.</p>

<p>Go ukip! Matthew, get over the gay marriage thing, or your infatuation with D Cameron, or Blair, or whatever your problem is. invitations to North London suppers? Your job at the soft left Times? You&#8217;re right that we have become lazy and entitled &#8211; but take a look at the ethnicity of benefit claimants. Take a look at London and the SE where most immigrants and jobs are concentrated. Ethnic minorities are far more likely to be on in or out of work benefits than &#8216;ethnically British&#8217; people. Which is yet another argument against unmanaged immigration and multiculturalism and an argument FOR ukip. it&#8217;s true that the Left, its evil public sector and lazy benefit classes and the BBC public schoolboy paternalistic leftie horror are a bigger problem than the EU &#8211; but Farage is still the only person standing against these problems in any way at all. David Cameron still harps on in his paternalistic, patrician way about &#8216;The Poor&#8217; &#8211; as if there are any genuinely poor people in the UK. &#8216;it&#8217;s not their fault!&#8217; He&#8217;s basically saying that anyone who isn&#8217;t privately educated is genetically inferior so must be helped (not sure how he expects to keep funding it). Yes, that really is the subtext, and we see it very well. He&#8217;s lying to himself, of course &#8211; he and his mates just want to keep all the good jobs and serious money for themselves and their families, hence the refusal to bring back grammar schools &#8211; so they can keep repressing us forever. ukip recognise that talent can come from anywhere in the world, but it won&#8217;t come where open borders and no strings welfare mean enslaving the hard working/talented few to keep in aristocratic leisure the untalented/lazy many of the whole world. ukip also champion grammar schools so that all, not just your establishment mates, can realise their potential. Ukip are meritocratic. They also see much in our culture that is worth celebrating, rather than being suppressed by our UK-hating Establishment. What&#8217;s not to like? Don&#8217;t you know that people like to feel good about themselves, not be lectured constantly about how they have so much to learn from woman and gay hating third world cultures? All cultures are NOT equal. And yes, we are living in a tyranny. We now lock up harmless British people for having ill advised drunken solitary rants and the crime of using BAD words while refusing to investigate violent crimes and funding Muslim organisations that want to obliterate our culture &#8211; see the source of funding for the Woolwich murderers prayer meetings. The only people who ever get deported in Britain are British people to face persecution in the US and EU for acts that are not crimes in the UK. Andew Simeou? Gary MacKinnon? Our Establishment has lost the plot. it&#8217;s insane &#8211; it actually seems to hate all British people and want to stamp them out. What did we do that was so bad? Hence ukip. Take your head out of your behind and go and meet some real people before you embarrass yourself any more.</p>

There is a very large power  which spends over 700 billion dollars a year on arms and is committed to the goals of a monopolar world based on globalized capital and values such as the cult of the individual, multiracialism and multiculturalism.<br />
  A UK which is not signed up to this will be unacceptable and will not happen.</p>

<p>Making these points is pointless however, as I&#8217;ve discovered with those on the left, who deny Hitler was a socialist, or that socialism and Islam are the two biggest killers of Humans in history, or that there are no social problems caused by &#8216;progressive&#8217; social policy, or that all the parties are following the Lenin plan (1921) for the destruction of the west, to the letter, when those of us down here at street level see a very different world to the one you would have us believe.</p>
<p>The absolute failure of the euro-zone, which commentators in growth economies like Australia are laughing at our economic incompetence (and making money from us, Google Steve Keen, one of the many who predicted the financial crash in advance).

<p>I didn&#8217;t vote Labour in 2010 (and for a number of previous elections).</p>
<p>I wasn&#8217;t accusing anyone of denial. I merely disagree that Hitler was a socialist. He was an extreme right-wing nationalist whose values had nothing to do with socialism. Rather they were rooted in the 19th c. Social Darwinism, Nationalism and Racism. Mao and Stalin were undeniably socialists, though in no way superior to Hitler, being just a cruel and callous.</p>
<p>I wouldn&#8217;t follow any leader &#8220;to the end&#8221;, though some I admire more than others (Churchill springs to mind). If I had to pick my favourite socialist it would be Clement Attlee. Not a man with a lot in common with Adolf.</p>

lecturer who was by then a libertarian outrider. I thought his ideas absurd and nothing since has convinced me otherwise. </p>
<p>You class political beliefs in terms of methods and not<br />
values. You also assume that there is a shared code of values between all left wingers (and indeed all right wingers too). Politics is far more nuanced. There<br />
is a spectrum of opinion on both the left and right. Finally you make the mistake of saying that political beliefs have remained unchanged since the 18th century. Adam Smith was a liberal in his time and was strongly criticised by Edmund Burke, the founder of modern conservatism. Who was right wing, Smith or Burke? </p>
<p>Taking your yardstick of placing a politician who increases<br />
the power of the state on the left then Churchill must be left wing. He was an advocate of rail and mine nationalisation in the 1920s, accepted mos
8000
t of Attlee’s reforms when he returned as PM, and significantly increased the power<br />
of government over trade as a Liberal minister before WWI.</p>
<p>What about Gordon Brown? He unwillingly bailed out the bank, but so did Bush, was he a socialist? Brown, as chancellor and prime minister, encouraged private sector involvement in state affairs: privatising the Tote, PFIs,<br />
Public-Private Partnership for the London Underground, private companies employed by the National Health, and the start of Academies. Was he right wing?</p>
<p>No one craved the destruction of government more than Marx, who said under communist the state would<br />
‘wither away’. Was he right wing?</p>
<p>To recap: Churchill and Hitler on the left, Brown and Marx<br />
on the right. Now do you see why I think this argument is absurd?</p>
<p>Also, who are true right wingers? Burkeans (who were/ are skeptical about an untrammelled free-market) or Neo-liberals like you. It is arrogant to say only your part of the spectrum are ‘true right.’ Look at the debate over<br />
selling forests or loosening green belt controls. Right wingers were on both sides of the debate. (We’re back to Burke v Smith here.)</p>
<p>And yes many on the extreme right are racist. Look at<br />
European politics today.</p>

As if to say, we still see our traditions as having some impact on how we actually spend money, the registration of marriage costing a few pounds in each case.  It is not as if the law has got through the Lords so it would seem again UKIP seem rightly skeptical on this policy, if a little outdated.

<p>So you keep up the good work old chap and with any luck in a few years time the Tory party will have passed into history and we can have a political party in power that represents the people and not the &#8216;enlightened Islington elite&#8217;.</p>

Because of course, you Kippers would never DREAM of belittling Tories, or vilifying them, would you?  No, when Kippers write about Tories, the tone is always one of understanding, compromise, tolerance and sweet reason.</p>

<p>Hit the nail on the head. The have no argument. They know the UKIP view is right. They know it speaks to the majority of the population. Once again i am called extreme for supporting UKIP. Some say UKIP are mad. It was once said that madness is performing the same task over and over again and expecting a different result. The LibLabCon&#8217;s of this world are unwilling to change and unfortunately for them they are now transparent. Narrow-minded, Profit-orientated, Elitists.</p>

You&#8217;ve started off with a conclusion &#8211; UKIP are extremists &#8211; and are then scrabbling around trying to find a justification, and come up with an embarrassingly poor one. If people like you tried to be logical (e.g. start with reasoning the pros and cons, and then create a conclusion based on those pros and cons later) then you would be much more rigorous in your thinking. You might even change your mind on some other issues. e.g. the idea that some small amount of influence in the rule-making process for the European market is worth more than the economic returns from FTAs from a dozen other markets.</p>

As you state the comments merely confirmed what you had assumed, I must conclude you had made your decision without devoting much effort to what UKIP, as a party, addresses with policy. </p>
<p>I have voted for UKIP twice because I have done what you have not. I recognised the utter contempt in which I, as an ordinary constituent, am held by the major parties, exemplified by the ratification of a very important EU treaty which I know few bothered to read. That is just one example, but there is a much more recent one, same sex marriage. If you ignore the issue it addresses, the important aspect of this is the manner in which it was very carefully introduced as legislation so the public could play no part in it. If this was for introducing the death penalty, would this process be acceptable?  I certainly hope not.</p>
<p>The people of Scotland have openly displayed their rejection of the established parties by voting SNP, despite there being no discernible increase in support for independence. English voters have had little option other than the established parties and voting has decreased as a consequence. UKIP&#8217;s appeal to those who haven&#8217;t voted for anyone should tell you it is not extremists it appeals to, it is the disenfranchised. That includes many who have voted for a party to oppose another, rather than in support of anything it represents and now they no longer have to, as they will recognise the possibility their vote for another party really will count for once. They can vote for something for a change.</p>
<p>There is some pride in this article that says in too many words &#8220;I told you so&#8221;, but all it really says is you are lacking in objectivity. The party you represented no longer represents its own members, never mind being genuinely interested in the electorate, and the electorate have an opportunity to advise you and them that that is not acceptable. That is not extremism, that is democracy. How sad you cannot recognise this.</p>

He calls UKIP supporters extremists because they see particular things that can be changed to improve Britain. His only repost is &#8220;that there is no overwhelming cause, but many: some insoluble&#8221;. i.e. it&#8217;s all too difficult so why bother trying to change anything. He and the metropolitan liberal elite (which he is a part of, so sees it as the norm rather than a small clique) are insulated from the problems faced by much of the country. When polling shows that all three major parties are out of step with public opinion then things do need to change. UKIP may never be the answer to any sensible question but they can be a catalyst for that change.</p>

I always enjoyed your pieces and thought you a sensible chap but this dismissal of the disgruntlement of millions of Britons suggests a sad lack of empathy. Can you really put your hand on your heart and say that that there is no metropolitan elite, no bien pensant core of British society? Thinks of my question next time you are quaffing champagne and canapes. Given all that has gone wrong in Britain in recent years, and the failure of the political class to respond to it in any way except to say that they know better and their critics are illiterate extremist louts, it is not surprising that many are looking to a new party &#8212; Alex Salmon and the SNP in Scot and UKIP in England. As a Conservative who really cannot stomach Cameron, Osborne, and Hague&#8211;and who wants a partial disengagement from the EU&#8211;my only home is UKIP at the moment. My vote is a protest vote and I have few expectations but I am not going to vote for politicians who simply put me down by telling me they know better.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-221651" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Speaking of treachery, I&#8217;ve just been reading this month’s issue of Standpoint – the fifth birthday edition, incidentally – in which Tim Congdon raises the horrifying but difficult to dismiss question of what might happen if an In-Out referendum on the EU were held under a pro-In government (of whatever stripe, but using Cameron as an example) that resulted in an “Out” vote.</p>
<p>Here’s Congdon’s question: “How would UKIP’s rank and file feel if<br />
they had worked hard to obtain a “no to the EU” vote in a bitter and<br />
exhausting referendum campaign, only for Cameron and his associates to betray the vote?”</p>
<p>I have to admit I hadn’t previously budgeted for the possibility<br />
raised by Mr Congdon. The main check on politicians in recent times has been the fourth estate, but for how long can that be guaranteed post-Leveson?</p>
<p>It would seem bizarre for a government to hold a referendum on the<br />
issue of EU membership without agreeing to be bound by the result –<br />
otherwise the whole thing would be a pointless waste of time, effort and money. But since this is what politicians specialise in, you wouldn’t want to put it past them, would you?</p>

<p>Sorry, couldn&#8217;t resist. . .</p>
<p>However, it is intellectually lazy of you to dismiss the growth of UKIP as a protest vote and the product of paranoid extremism. There is a Darwinian element to the emergence and evolution of political parties just as there is with living things; they are shaped by but also in turn shape their environment. It has been on the cards that UKIP or something like it would eventually emerge. The European Union environment is not a stable one. Its long term objective of union, harmonisation, homogeneity, standardisation and centralised control is inherently entropy reductive, but in the real world evolution is entropy expansive and the strain between the these two states is now starting to show. The EU &#8220;project&#8221; is beginning to come apart and in the process creating newer environments in which alternative ideologies can take root and prosper &#8211; that doesn&#8217;t de facto make them the product of extremism and paranoia, it merely means that the current environmental conditions as no longer amenable to support the status quo.</p>

<p>I well remember delivering election leaflets in 1979 in which the Labour Party parodied your position on housing. You may recall it: you had taken a reasonable position as to someone&#8217;s entitlement. The Labour Party, feeling afraid of Mrs Thatcher&#8217;s advance, called you extremist. In today&#8217;s terms, I suppose, swivel-eyed.</p>
<p>You were, of course
8000
, completely correct and I acknowledge that now (it has taken me a bit too long).</p>
<p>But extremism is in the eye of the beholder. Anyone threatened will call his or her threatener &#8216;extremist&#8217;.</p>
<p>You appear to argue that UKIP, by uniting things such as political correctness, the EU, curtailments on free speech etc, rather than approaching them one by one that you have uncovered evidence of lack of moderation.</p>
<p>What form of evidence is that?</p>
<p>You will remember how Mrs Thatcher saw union power. She looked at high taxes. She observed inflation which is a tax on savers. She looked for a common theme. She identified that theme as being state control and a lack of liberty.</p>
<p>That is what every political philosophy does: it looks for links. To approach a series of problems as if each is unconnected is the mark of an uneducated fool &#8211; which you certainly are not.</p>
<p>Why then, must UKIP be denigrated for also seeking such links when such an exercise is the only way to tackle problems which are rarely independent of each other?</p>
<p>You are an honourable man &#8211; but I believe you assign faults to UKIP which are just not there.</p>

<p>You posit that extremism is when you single out and obsess over one cause for your grievances. </p>
<p>The grievances of UKIP and others can be condensed, as you correctly put it, into the issues you suggest. </p>
<p>They can in fact be put into one word &#8216;Leftism&#8217; i.e. Liberalism or Socialisism or a bit of both. </p>
<p>You give further examples yourself of your own take on the causes for<br />
Britain ’s problems (eg. welfare dependency) which are also caused by<br />
Leftism.</p>
<p>&#8216;Metropolitan elite&#8217; &#8211; You’re thinking &#8216;New world order&#8217;. No.<br />
This means that we are run by people who do not share the same values as the overwhelming majority of Britains .<br />
Immigration is a classic example. Hate crime another. No one ever voted for this.<br />
No party ever put it in their manifesto. Yet it happened and the voters<br />
didn&#8217;t want it anymore than the Spanish want hoards of English in their<br />
villages in the Costa. Yet you were called racists (unlike the Spaniards<br />
 would be) if you objected to this and then being racists was made a<br />
crime. No one voted or asked for that either. It is out of kilter with<br />
our society and yet it has been foisted upon us.</p>
<p>  Benefits and unskilled immigration are inextricably linked and one can not be<br />
discussed without the other. You don&#8217;t seem to realise this. It was only a year ago that the number who entered unemployment matched exactly the immigration stats. </p>
<p>It is interesting you evoke McCarthyism. McCarthyism was essentially<br />
right. There were Communists in the US ; they were in league with the<br />
USSR . Communism was a miserable and murderous regime that had to be<br />
avoided. The US fought that war well and won. They won because they had<br />
the enemy in their back garden and they understood them.</p>

<p>Add to that hypocrisy because whilst he accuses UKIP supporters of a extremism of simplification his one dimensional stereotyping of UKIP supporters is guilty of a similar extremism and one that seems to be something to do with a certain snobbery that seems to be based in his self-image..</p>
<p>This article is nothing more than the journalistic version of Ken Clarke&#8217;s ridiculous rant. Perhaps these two old duffers should get together and form a comedy double act? They could do a tour of the country telling people exactly what they think of UKIP and the sort of people UKIP attracts and do Nigel Farage&#8217;s job for him.</p>
<p>That is one of the biggest reason for the UKIP uprising and for the current divisions in the Conservative Party is that far too many of the political class are exactly like Parris and frankly people are sick and tired of their condescending sneering. So I hope Parris continues to publish long and loud because as I said it is his ilk that is doing Farage&#8217;s job for him!</p>
<p>Finally knowing that Parris wants nothing to do with UKIP is greatly reassuring because I am sure that few of them want anything to do with him either!</p>

<p>Actually I really dislike Paris calling me, a life long, 50 years plus, conservative supporter, an extremist.  It seems to me to be a cheap shot, no attempt to understand why Cameron&#8217;s views are not mine, why I regard Osborne as a sad incompetent joke, why the sheer inadequacy of our political class in relation to Europe disgusts me.</p>
<p>I will split the Conservative vote until the Conservatives become conservatives again.</p>
<p>Parris should get out into the saloon bars of Derbyshire and talk to real people.. He reminds me why I no longer buy the Times.</p>

<p>And if you want to see a REAL personal attack, then consider this &#8211; current opinion polls of the UK have an EU in/out opinion roughly matched at around 40%, so the idea that a normal member of the public cannot possibly hold different opinions to you is a significant indicator as to your personal level of derangement.</p>

<p> Farage is described by some of our &#8216;betters&#8217; as &#8216;provincial&#8217;. Although the description is merely intended to be dismissive, and it may explain why UKIP does so much better outside London.</p>
<p>When I listen to UKIP&#8217;s potential voters, a common observation is that the only party lead by a leader, rather than by a manager, is UKIP. Farage is lucky to have such colourless opponents.</p>
<p>Cameron&#8217;s referendum offer, after a putative &#8216;re-negotiation is entirely implausible. It is helping UKIP, not hurting them. He would have been better advised to have been honest.</p>
<p>And for sure we would not join the EU now, if we were not already members, would we?</p>

<p>That people can be against the EU, multi-culturism and mass immigration is somehow confusing to Mr. Parris. What you have to understand Matthew, is that you have one vote.

<p>PS. I would never refer to anyone who did not agree with me as simple &#8211; unlike the &#8220;newspapers&#8221; I have mentioned.</p>

<p>Well that&#8217;s a good even handed start.</p>
<p>‘liberal’, ‘metropolitan’, and ‘elite’</p>
<p>The so called London  ‘liberal’, ‘metropolitan’, and ‘elite’ did actually change the face of Britain deliberately to suit their own ends, it certainly was not to ordinary peoples advantage that areas of towns and cities are swathed in no go areas, and not as you say with immigrants toiling away doing the work that feckless whites wont do.<br />
In areas with large populations of Pakistani and Somali immigrants hardly any work and the ones that do graft are servicing local needs.</p>
<p>In predominantly Black areas the savagery of some of the inhabitants drove out large communities of mainly white communities, in areas of high Muslim immigration they are almost ethnically cleansed of Christians. ‘</p>
<p>This might not be hell to you Mr Parris, but the majority of people in this country do not live as your  ‘liberal’, ‘metropolitan’, and ‘elite’ in areas inhabited by BBC type ethnics, the majority do not have BBC blacks like Lenny Henry as a neighbour they have someone a lot more dangerous.</p>

misunderstood the motivation of us new UKIP members and is not playing silly<br />
games. As a paid up member of UKIP (something I have never done for any other<br />
party), I can explain my motivations very differently. Matthew seems to think<br />
that because I am against uncontrolled immigration, I hate immigrants. I don’t;<br />
I loath the politicians who have allowed it to happen. I don’t hate the EU; I<br />
loath the politicians who lied to us about its impact on our sovereignty and<br />
the witless way they roll over and accept its undemocratic dictates. I don’t<br />
hate welfare recipients; I loath the politicians who have been too gutless to<br />
correct a faulty system. Similarly, a parallel example, I don’t hate tax<br />
avoiders; I loath the inept and unprofessional legislators who have failed to<br />
implement a system that works effectively. Given the single common factor here,<br />
what to do? Each of the three political parties who have enjoyed power over the<br />
last sixteen years are covered in guilt but I wish to exercise my right to a<br />
vote and must choose. I choose the new party that has no record of ineptitude<br />
or malfeasance. Name-calling me an extremist is not only wrong and insulting,<br />
it entirely misses the point and purpose of my support for UKIP and the reason<br />
this is growing across the country.</p>

If memory serves me right, the conflict or disagreement is at the very root of politics as such. Political landscape has been dominated by &#8220;we-all-singing-from-the-same-hymn-sheet&#8221; approach, which is contrary to real political struggles, so UKIP is a good reminder of what&#8217;s politics is all about. One more interesting thing that parties that propose to stand for &#8220;national interest&#8221; spring around Europe and seem to be champions of &#8220;nation state&#8221; or at least take a stand against some visible or perceived encroachment on the territory of the nation-state. So, it&#8217;s back to basics , namely the issue of sovereignty.</p>

He can&#8217;t bear the idea of UKIP – a party which stands diametrically opposite him. Well watch them take a huge bite out of CONLAB&#8217;s voting rumps. Lib Dems, bye bye for the next 30 years&#8230;.not nice knowing you. Maybe you&#8217;ll pop up next in Labour&#8217;s bed&#8230;they may need you &#8220;prop them up&#8221;. I am sure UKIP like every political party will have its downs, but on a few crisp points they score bullseyes (for me, anyway). Is UKIP peopled by extremists? Yes, perhaps. Ones that might reverse the Labour party&#8217;s own form of extremism that was, under the self-serving Blair. Why did Cameron table a EU referendum in 2017? Because he knows that the yellow and purples are going to marshall the &#8220;sick and tired&#8221; of GB. Rant over.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-219131" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I think you totally miss the point. UKIP is a response to the failure of the electoral system and the three main parties. You simply cannot have an effective political system if it is set with an in-built bias. It is rather like expecting a bowl to run straight. It isn&#8217;t going to happen. The result is obvious &#8211; disaffection. Democracy cannot and shouldn&#8217;t function with one flavour and governments that consistently put a minority interest above the majority. It&#8217;s a thesis without an antithesis. As for synthesis, you know how to whistle don&#8217;t you? </p>
<p>This is where UKIP comes into it own. UKIP looks to Europe for its scapegoat &#8211; and heavens, there is enough wrong there to make it a likely culprit &#8211; but the real fault lies closer to home. It lies in democracy/representation deficit disorder. The government doesn&#8217;t seem to realise it is supposed to be for the people, by the people&#8230; If it isn&#8217;t that &#8211; and there is prime facie evidence that it isn&#8217;t &#8211; then you have to ask for whom it exists. Enter: UKIP. Sights set, it continues to blast off at Europe, when the skulking, shifty, Golem is staring them in the face and claiming expenses on houses it doesn&#8217;t live in and on moats around those that it does. Westminster is a cosy, corrupt, fief; a place of patronage and rotten boroughism, where often the last consideration is for those who voted.</p>
<p>UKIP&#8217;s sound and fury is a lot of contrived nonsense shooting off at the wrong targets but it does have a political role to play. It shows up the whole unrepresentative, unresponsive charade for what it really is &#8211; a dire con on the British public.</p>
<p>National sovereignty with or without Europe is leeching away. If it wasn&#8217;t because of successive governments agreeing reciprocal arrangements with the EU, it would because of trans-national corporations frightening Britannia into believing she didn&#8217;t need knickers and that she could rely on them to choose her wardrobe.</p>
<p>&#8220;The first is that bugbear I identified in my email to Ronald: all or any of the words ‘liberal’, ‘metropolitan’, and ‘elite’. This idea that there is a conspiracy of the privileged to cheat and oppress the masses, forcing them beneath a yoke in which alien agencies are involved, leaps from any study not only of Marxism but (on the right) of Poujadism and Peronism.&#8221; </p>
<p>Let me ask you something, where do you think the present political trajectory leads? Does it lead to a more equal or inclusive society or does it take us in the opposite direction? British politics only ever plays with half the deck. Surely, having served in it, you must know that by now?</p>
<p>It is a case of aphids, ants and superants and about as interesting. The real question is, when can the electorate expect to get a fully functioning, representative democracy in Britain? We&#8217;ve had the Stefordian charade, how about something real that appeals to the majority?</p>

Why does having considered opinions make you extremist? The trouble is though, the Government doesn&#8217;t really seem as if it wants its citizens to have views on anything at all. UKIP challenges make it less possible to cover-up. So they label those who speak out about key subjects and policy implementation as in need of psychiatric help. It&#8217;s up to the Government and opposition parties to convince the electorate that the their ideology is better than UKIP&#8217;s, not criticise those who threaten to expose the EU for what it really is. Despite his intelligence, our Prime Minister can&#8217;t seem to put a better argument forward though and that is clearly worrying many who expect senior politicians to stick their neck out and show leadership in difficult times. UKIP&#8217;s popularity is not not about a single issue as Matthew Parris claims, because &#8211; as we have witnessed in recent years &#8211; Britain, fuelled by inaction is becoming a haven for the worst kinds of human nature, economic failure, political corruption and extremism. The EU and Government merely endorses this by doing nothing and effectively telling us all to shut up and live with it. At least UKIP recognises that there is a problem to deal with in the first instance.</p>

My point put explicitly is that there are a number of comments here from &#8216;Ukippers&#8217; which are exactly the kind of comments which represent the argument that Mr Parris argues so cogently against; because UKIP have such a misguided &#8216;slay-the-hydra&#8217; approach to the EU, the party attracts people who have such a &#8220;single-cause, single-prism, single-root-explanation way of interpreting the world and its sorrows&#8221;  and the comments here seem to be largely representative of such a mindset. It is a shame really as I thought a motto of this paper was &#8216;not to think alike,&#8217; perhaps not though?</p>

Nigel Farage is the only one willing to take on the Radicals in fact he is the only one willing to confront  anyone So lets give him a chance, He can at least relate to the man in the street,he has run his own business,You cant say that about Cameron and the millionaires club.</p>

I honestly believe that the current state of Britain cannot be solved and recitified by the current batch of politicians.  I have come to believe that there is now in most Western &#8220;Democracies&#8221; a ruling class, which encompasses all the major parties and is fundementally opposed to personal freedom.  You see it in the plethora of laws governing interpersonal relationships, you see it when people not smiling enough at olympic events are arrested, you see it when people are imprisoned for expressing racist views on Twitter but others are given probation for repeated burglary.  In the current model we are suffering from the tyranny of the agressive minority.  If enough activists can get enough column inches, they can make almost anything illegal (or legal).  You get the Prime Minister Of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland commenting on a footballer biting another footballer when he is on an important trade mission, you get homosexual marriage as a priority even though in all probability less than 1% of the population is gay and not all of them want it.  I would support UKIP if I still lived in the UK, even though I think Nigel Farage is the acceptable face of some pretty extreme people, mainly because I loathe the shiney faced PR buffoon who is &#8220;leading&#8221; Britain now, along with all of his chums.  Add to that the thought of supporting a party thet stubbornly refuses to slaughter Ed Balls is not acceptable.</p>

How else can you describe an organisation that has no democratic legitimacy, but felt it had the right to depose two elected Prime Ministers in order to protect itself.<br />
How else can you describe an organisation that felt it had the right to steal from ordinary peoples&#8217; bank accounts in order to protect itself.<br />
How else can you describe an organisation that ignores the result of successive Referenda when they don&#8217;t go the way they want &#8211; and then either changes the &#8216;rules&#8217; halfway through to ensure that the next one IS passed or, better still, changes procedures in order to avoid them completely.<br />
You cannot be a little bit Sovereign.  You either are or you aren&#8217;t.<br />
The EU&#8217;s raison d&#8217;etre is to destroy national Sovereignties in favour of its own supra-national organisation and government by the Elite, for the Elite, on behalf of the Elite.<br />
I want my own elected Parliament to make the law in this country.  And &#8211; if we don&#8217;t agree with it &#8211; I want to the power to vote them out.   That isn&#8217;t possible whilst we remain in the EU:  most of our laws originate in the EU and are imposed on us.<br />
I want my country back.  That means voting UKIP.</p>

Wrong! What has to be countered is the scource of them, which is largely the EU and the politics (art of the possible!) of those seemingly hell-bent on giving Britain&#8217;s sovereignty away &#8211; in fact &#8211; has already done so!<br />
So, call away Matthew! Sticks and stones etc. BUT the growing majority of the electorate are in agreement with The United Kingdom Party, not the pathetic, self (and EU) serving coalition!</p>

<p>As a longtime Times&#8217; reader, I have enjoyed reading your articles for many years. Similarly, I am a lifelong Tory voter but have become very disgruntled of late.</p>
<p>Where I live there is no doubt that there has been a definite impact on the local demographics secondary to the recent rates of immigration. I had genuine hope Mr Cameron and Mr Osborne would bring a sensible, firm Conservative approach to this and many other problems: sadly, I have been gravely disappointed.</p>
<p>May I ask, as you are much closer to the upper echelons of the Conservative Party, what would be an acceptable level of new immigrants into the UK per annum? Can I ask you don&#8217;t use &#8220;net immigration&#8221; as I think this term is insulting.</p>
<p>I would appreciate your response.</p>

<p>The UK Independence party is not an extremist party at all, but I imagine your faith in the direction of travel the Tories have taken of late blinds you to observing these wider events in the country.</p>

<p>I just think the British people have been badly let down by politicians of all parties who increasingly hold them and their &#8216;unfashionable&#8217; views on education, patriotism, benefit reform, the EU and immigration in contempt. Anyone who reads Mr Parris in the Times (and his excellent book Chance Witness) will know he largely took this view of the electorate himself when he was an MP. I remember him saying &#8216;some of the electorate are pretty contemptible&#8217;. At least he had the guts to say what many of the political class actually think &#8211; and to be fair he generally puts his money where his mouth is.</p>
<p>However, the Conservative Party is slowly dying &#8211; like all the mainstream political parties. The tectonic plates are shifting both in England with UKIP and through the SNP in Scotland. I am not naive enough to believe UKIP has all the answers but at least they are asking the questions that others will not.</p>
<p>The SNP was dismissed as an irrelevance as recently as the late 90s. Now they run Scotland and are dictating the terms of the Scottish independence debate. UKIP will have the same impact in England although it will be an evolution not a revolution. It&#8217;s time and high time the political establishment and commentariat woke up to the fact their world is changing. Just as we took so long to work out so had ours.</p>

Listen-up, UKIPers, the Westminster Establishment will pound the alarm of negativity against you; continuously moving from one policy,  to the next.  Some policies,  even have &#8216;seasons&#8217; for how effective they are on brainwashing the public. George Gunn, and Mike Small have a &#8216;related&#8217; articles you should read on Bella-ra-Fella.<br />
Matthew, the writing is on the wall; UKIP are the first of the new far right parties,  that will gain popularity, and pace; the Westminster Establishment cannot hold back the surging tide of electoral resentment. We are witnessing the beginning of a new political era for Britain. Westminster is dead,  long live the people. </p>

I think you are talking about UKIP’s membership rather than the substantial numbers of new voters they are attracting. The two are not the same thing and the latter are more important: a party polling around the 25% mark has to be taken seriously. </p>
<p> UKIP&#8217;s new voters are expressing their opposition to LibLabCon. LibLabCon politicians may say different things from each other, but they speak in the same language and share the same underlying assumptions. People are voting for UKIP because they consider the language to be false and the assumptions to be wrong. Immigration is not the only example of this, but it is the single most important example. </p>
<p>On the subject of immigration, LibLabCon speak a language which is based on ideological obsessions, not reality. Certain facts about immigration are well-known in the real world but are completely off limits for those in the Westminster bubble and their cheerleaders in the media. Some groups of immigrants commit disproportionate levels of crime; some, in average/relative terms, consistently underachieve academically; other groups have, in general, integrated badly with the host population. Even if you ignore specific issues such as these, mass immigration has, unsurprisingly, been shown to worsen civic engagement and community relations in just about every measurable way.  </p>
<p>But you will never hear any recognition of this from LibLabCon, only about ‘vibrant diversity’ or ‘enrichment of the culture’ or some other such clichéd guff. Politicians who parrot out this sort of nonsense sound like what they are: phony and inauthentic. Farage does not sound phony or inauthentic. That is why his net approval rating is so high whereas MiliCam Clegg’s net approval ratings are all heavily in the red.</p>

<p>Which of these two justifications for gay marriage do you prefer?</p>
<p>1) Allowing gay couples to get married won&#8217;t harm straight people. So if getting married would make a gay couple happy, they should be allowed to. Live and let live.</p>
<p>2) Homosexuality is just another version of heterosexuality. There are no qualitative differences between them. Anyone who disagrees is a bigot.</p>
<p>I suspect that most people who have not taken entrenched sides are far more likely to be persuaded by justification (1). However, we heard a whole lot more of (2) than we did of (1).</p>
<p>Bizarrely, peop
8000
le who give justification (2) describe themselves as &#8216;social liberals.&#8217; Ironically, the attitude underlying justification (2) has more similarities with the attitude of the churchmen who burned heretics at the stake a few centuries ago than it does with liberalism, on any reasonable definition of that term.</p>

<p>The many new members who are constantly signing up and joining us are moderates (Procedures exist for checking this out). Even Labour councillors, such as one in Grimsby last week, are now coming over to UKIP.</p>

<p>Extremists have no place in UKIP. This is not a party for them at all. They belong elsewhere, in the EDL, BNP or National Front, for example.</p>
<p>You may not like it or agree with it, but we are a moderate and considerate party with supporters from almost all ethnic groups. How do I know? Because I have met them at party conferences, as party candidates, as members and as donators of funds.</p>
<p>I know that the Tories are getting upset about losing their elected councillors, members and supporters to UKIP. But so are Labour, Lib Dems and even the Green party. (our candidate in the Bradford West By-election, was an ex-Green member)</p>

<p>Do really think anyone would openly admit to such deception?</p>
<p>Each of the main parties have had people who have tried to deceive. What does this prove? Such individuals will hardly receive a welcome will they.</p>
<p>Just think we achieved 23+% of the vote in the recent elections held on May 2 and as many as 46.5% in Rotherham where we returned a UKIP councillor in a Labour stronghold. A marvellous result.</p>
<p>All I can say Martin, is that you seem to be most upset by our recent successes. Just imagine what 2014 and 2015 may bring in the European and general elections..</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-220891" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>So it seems Matthew Parris is one of those Tories who likes to mock and insult the core vote. Well I hope you succeed in one of the things you call for in this article. If the right-wing elements are &#8216;repelled&#8217;, the Tory party will lose any hope of rekindling mass public appeal and can finally rot away. The slimy arrogance of people like you and Ken Clarke disgusts me, and under your ascendancy the party will get exactly what it deserves.</p>
<p>You forget that the place of the Tory party in British politics is not assured by divine right. If you insult your supporters long enough, if you liken them to extremists and claim they are ‘in need of psychiatric help&#8217;, they will desert you and the party will crumble.</p>
<p>UKIP’s incredible success represents something quite remarkable: a genuinely democratic shake-up of the political consensus, the first to take place for a very long time. It gives a voice to the disenchantment which has been felt for years in this country towards the left-leaning political class (of course if you are one of these people, i.e. one of the majority of people in this country, Matthew thinks you are, amongst other things, &#8216;paranoid&#8217;, ‘extreme’ and comparable to witch burners of the 17th century) .</p>
<p>Perhaps if he were more politically attuned, Matthew would seek to harness this force and steer it back to the mainstream, rather than let it flutter about on the fringes. Instead, he labels those involved as extremists, rules out any prospect of compromise and helps seal the imminent self-destruction of his party.</p>
<p>His desire to expel the &#8216;extreme&#8217; elements from the Tory party is actually quite funny. What he doesn&#8217;t realise is that the bulk of right-leaning people in this country would vote to oust him and his ilk from the Tory party, not the right-wing elements who he believes are wanting of &#8216;psychiatric help&#8217;.</p>
<p>Also, he waves away the idea of a ’liberal metropolitan elite’, likening it to a conspiracy theory. But this is just a weak attempt to dismiss the obvious. It’s not a matter of secret societies and shady backroom deals but a particular mindset which shows itself quite openly, whether in the courts or on Question Time, and which everyone apart from him can see. (Even Andrew Marr has testified to the “innate liberal bias” of the BBC.) By sneering at this, Matthew once again highlights the distance between himself and the core Tory voters. Thankfully the party he represents is not immortal; voters will only put up with these insults for so long before they take their custom elsewhere.</p>

There are still several parts of their platform which raise red flags for me over how minorities would be treated when they took power, and some of their talk about liberal elites who enable scroungers can become Producerist boilerplate soaked in racist code if they start pushing certain buttons or develop it into a &#8220;conspiracy&#8221; narrative, but as far as UKIP now- judged by their manifesto, Farage statements, representative views of supporters and the majority of those Councillors they got elected once the few nuts are left out- there are significant differences between the &#8220;hard&#8221; right and the &#8220;far&#8221; right, which includes fascists among other ideologies based on a severe ethno-nationalism.and authoritarian state. </p>
<p>They are closer to Tea Party &#8220;God, gays and guns&#8221; Republicans except that few mention guns (unlike the BNP), and due to the low prevalence of hard-line Christian social conservatism here, they speak of God and the return of Christian values only vaguely and are only symbolically committed to heteronormativity, far from the sort of anti-gay stances and rhetoric that typify that brand of US politico/voter. There has not been much of the masculinist appeals to gender stereotype seen in the Far Right  either. They are also tolerant of diverse views on abortion, like all UK parties to the right of the Greens and (social) left of the Christian People&#8217;s Alliance. Militarism has never been their high point either&#8230; I agree UKIP have some worrying and possibly unworkable ideas but fascism is really overstating the case.</p>
<p>David Neiwert, an expert on this subject having covered bigots and extremists for 35 years, speaks of US right-wing ideology at the height of Bush II and fascism here, <a href="http://dneiwert.blogspot.co.uk/Rush%20Newspeak%20%20Fascism.pdf" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','download','http://dneiwert.blogspot.co.uk/Rush%20Newspeak%20%20Fascism.pdf']);" rel="nofollow">http://dneiwert.blogspot.co.uk/Rush%20Newspeak%20%20Fascism.pdf</a><br />
concluding they are not the same although further escalation of economic downturn and cultural hostility could turn a hard-right, &#8220;traditionalist&#8221; movement under most mature social systems into a variant of fascism.</p>

Of course, heavily simplified revivalist religion does fit your caricature, but that does not account for the majority of us.</p>
<p>Second, whilst there is such a strong willingness on the Centre and Left to stand up for Saudi-funded fascism, I find it difficult to get that worked up about the domestic right-wing.  Saudi-affiliated groups murder lots of people daily, whereas even the nastiest domestic groups have murdered a few people ever.  If your innuendo is to link mainstream political parties with fascism, then perhaps Andrew Gilligan&#8217;s work in East London is mining a richer seam.</p>
<p>Third, your comments about conspiratorial thinking are quite obviously correct.  Again, the anti-Western, anti-British and anti-English propaganda from the Left is probably your best place to start.  When you have exhausted that, there may well be something for you to investigate at UKIP.</p>

8000
and you decided, on reflection you were absolutely right. And as you say, there are an awful lot of lunatics in this country. People who cannot understand the unalloyed joy they should be experiencing under the benevolent government of the identikit Con/Lab/LibDem&#8217;s.<br />
You fall into the Left liberal role of mocking something that you accuse others of saying (or thinking) to generate a world that doesn&#8217;t exist. Maybe, just maybe the reason we don&#8217;t currently have a UKIP government is that too many of the &#8216;lunatics&#8217; actually don&#8217;t want the whole UKIP package, but do agree with the core of their ideas. We don&#8217;t want unfettered immigration, at least not while our idiotic, Left liberal welfare system is so attractive to so many. The lovely, Socialist France doesn&#8217;t allow it, so how did UKIP manage that, in a foreign country? It must be their fault, surely? No one else has such mad ideas? Except this very large proportion of the UK population. Is the EU the Soviet Union? Clearly not, we haven&#8217;t been fully subsumed yet. You can only be thankful that, whilst that is the goal (you can only argue if you believe no one can read EU documents), they are at least going about it peacefully and without the tanks. At present. And let us look at the current, biggest issue, the strangely titled &#8216;gay marriage&#8217;. There are two fundamentally important issues here. One is that the overwhelming majority of the people in this country (and many others it seems) are completely against this pointless, politically inspired agitation. They are being ignored. The second outrage is that no-one seems to want to mention that the issue of homosexual marriage is being forced on us (and those others) by more interference from an unaccountable body in &#8216;Europe&#8217;. UKIP is not the solution, there I can agree, but it is a sign of how far democracy in this country has been removed that it is the only near realistic option available to the people, people who are fed up of being lied to and misled whilst things are done in Brussels that we cannot control. So no, I don&#8217;t want to vote UKIP, but why would I vote for a Conservative party, my natural inclination, that is unrecognisable as such and indistinguishable from the Labour party. All of whom just carry on doing what they are told from abroad, whilst pretending that either the EU doesn&#8217;t exist or that they have some say in it. (Yes, one in 27).</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-221441" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Matthew: An excellent piece. I found exactly the same response from commenters when I wrote a blog over six months for the Telegraph. I support the EU, while believing it to be in urgent need of reform. The Faragistas who dominate readers&#8217; responses at the Telegraph rended me like dogs. It was never enough for me to point out that I shared many of their concerns, on the power of the Commission, on unfettered immigration, on the transfer of powers unnecessarily to Brussels. I was a<br />
 dupe of the evil tyrants in Europe whose chief goal was to humiliate Britain and reduce it to beggary. I was insulted at every turn. On one occasion, I was told that my dead father must have been a spineless coward to have raised a son like me. When I voluntarily gave up my blog, commenters crowed that I had been sacked and run out of town. It was, all in all, a disturbing, un-British experience – and made a mockery of the idea of free speech.</p>
<p>You are absolutely right in your argument. Most UKIP supporters are paranoid. We see this in the comments below by people who thought you intelligent until your raised your voice against their beloved movement. The good news is that they do not represent a majority of voters. Instead, they are a throwback to the attitudes of the 1930s, when Jews were blamed by an angry and frustrated minority for Britain&#8217;s ills and (ironically) there were calls for the UK to appease, and even make common cause, with the Fascist powers of Germany and Italy.</p>
<p>Britain faces a host of problems. So does France, so does America, so, even, does<br />
Germany (which requires a prosperous world into which to sell its goods). Immigration is a serious issue, as is militant Islam, as is the decline of British manufacturing, as is climate change. One can only laugh at the sabre-rattling of Cameron and Hague in relation to Syria when viewed against reports of how few soldiers we can afford, how few ships and how few aircraft.</p>
<p>Whatever problems exist, it is up to Britain, working with its friends and allies, to solve them – and I would include in that the need to redress the worsening imbalance between rich and poor, which is the source, ultimately, of so much<br />
discontent.</p>
<p>No country – not even Britain – is an island, not in the the 21st century. it is time we wakened up to the fact and faced our problems one-by-one. To blame everything on foreigners is to miss the point of the world in which, inescapably, we now live.</p>

<p>Your comment on UKIP voters is precisely wrong, though, I think you&#8217;ll find that many of the twenty-something % of the population who currently support them are mostly quite ordinary, even if internet commenters are not.  Personally, I am all in favour of European cooperation, so long as the EU institutions can be neutered in the style of the Holy Roman Emperors.  Fortunately, Merkel seems to be achieving this pretty well on her own, so there may be no need for me to vote UKIP.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-222141" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Matthew Parris and several of the commenters have described UKIP as rude and extremist and worse.  Well, robust  yes; extremist, hardly.   British politics is confrontational not consensual and with its tradition of satire, scandal and sedition is about settling old scores, real or imagined and we can hardly wait to put the boot in.  There are areas of discussion where the liberal mainstream display all the sensibilities of a Victorian maiden aunt and if they enter into debate on the interweb wishing simply to hear the echo of their own voice they will be sadly disappointed.</p>
<p> Try bringing up the subject of the effects of population displacement and the resultant destabilisation upon country, society and liberty.  Try the classical Christian doctrine that the promotion of pederasty and sapphism are anarchic, sterile, hedonistic, and socially damaging pastimes which destabilise the family and society.  Try postulating that the introduction of euthanasia and abortion, turn us into a nation of old people, further the task of population reduction, damage the fabric of family and society and are intrinsically evil.   Try suggesting that the debauchment of the education system is a deliberate policy to reduce a sense of identity and to produce an ignorant and supine untermensch.  Try  pointing out that the left, using entryism, and with previous points in mind, have corrupted the integrity of the schools, the judiciary, the civil service, local government, councils, the social services, the BBC and the police, and have also made a start on the armed forces.</p>
<p>Try the hypothesis that the left having rejected the set of absolute moral values willed to it by Christianity and Judaism and no longer having a coherent set of moral ethics, have filled the vacuum with a mess of single conflicting issues, which in the words of Phillip Blond, have &#8220;repudiated and vilified the very structure and basis of society itself.&#8221; </p>
<p> Try all that and you will be in for a very dusty time; you will be cast into the outer darkness with rudeness and discourtesy.  Great as the temptation is to snigger at all this pompous maiden auntery, they are the most serious issues of our age and need to be debated since they affect the very nature of self and how we see our future.  In the end reality always breaks in, and the longer we leave it the more traumatic it will be when it does. Leonard Shapiro wrote of Soviet Russia that &#8220;the true object of propaganda is neither to convince nor even to persuade, but to produce a uniform pattern of public utterance in which the first trace of unorthodox thought reveals itself as a jarring dissonance.&#8221;</p>

All these folk are breeding like bunnies. They are beginning to get stroppy, demanding shariah law zones, killing soldiers in the street, planning bomb attacks against the EDL in Dewsbury. Enoch is beginning to look like a prophet.<br />
 We may still avoid the coming crap times if government acts now. Dave, Tony, Millipede, Clegg&#8230;well they are not the boys to say the least.</p>
<p>Mathew Parris &#8211; a nice enough bloke in his way- I suppose, but he lives in a parallel universe and does not give a swing about non-political people whatever their class,<br />
(just like all his pals in parliament). He has lost touch with the world we live in.</p>
<p>So what can he tell us about extremism? About events in Woolwich he is oddly silent.<br />
About the hatemongers all over the internet he has nowt to report.<br />
But about a possible threat to the Tory party he waxes almost lyrical in his bid to do them down.</p>
<p>Matt, baby, learn this, take it to heart: the time is rapidly coming when we need extremism, when we will have to act to save our culture, our society. Wake up, smell the onions.</p>

Are all these people extremists? Or do they like a party which trusts the British people to make up their own minds on who governs Britian? You may have decided that the EU is a good thing &#8211; but that does not give you and your friends the right to dictate to everyone else! And as for describing the EU as a tyranny, who ignored the stated wishes of the people of France Holland and Ireland over the Lisbon Treaty? Who, after Denmark and Sweden both rejected the Euro, refused to have a referendum in any one of the 17 Eurozone memebers on whether they join the currency? Who removed the democratically elected cabinets of Italy and Greece and replaced them with unelected EU puppets? How would Mr Parris feel if every member of the British Cabinet had been taken from the House of Lords and The Prime Minister was Peter Mandleson? And I nearly forgot, which is the only body in the EU which can propose or repeal EU legislation?</p>

Let me confirm his opinion. I am mad. Why? Because I think that I was born free (in 1967) and am now not free. That is because I cannot sack through the ballot box those people who make the laws and rules that govern my life when i do not like the laws that they make. Many of those rules come directly or indirectly from the EU. The ability to decide who makes the rules by which we live is surely an essential component of democracy. The really terrible thing is that my right to choose my lawmakers through the ballot box was not taken from me by a foreign power. It was given away by those who through their election to Parliament, were entrusted with the protection of my rights. So, yes Mathew. I am mad. Mad with indignation and mad with anger on behalf not just of myself, but of those who sacrificed so much in numerous conflicts in order to protect my freedoms. I do not think this has come about through some Machiavellian conspiracy of betrayal but betrayal is nevertheless the cumulative effect of a thousand acts of individual cowardice, greed or wrong- thinking ideology. </p>

When you call a political party extremist, that is harsh word. It is a word reserved for people who are clearly racist or violent. At the very least, they must materially support such groups. (Not a one-off thing but whose party regularly calls for violence or supports it openly.) There are tons of parties in Europe, either right wing or Islamic, which openly do this. Ukip is not one of them, so far as I see at this time.</p>
<p>I hate to say it, but it&#8217;s very clear to me, and many North Americans that Britain doesn&#8217;t really care about its culture.</p>

<p>The United Kingdom Independence Party leader welcomed news that the local<br />
and European elections will be held on the same day, 22 May 2014.</p>
<p>The change is seen by experts as a boost for Ukip because it will<br />
increase turnout for the Euro elections, which Mr Farage is hoping to<br />
win.</p>
<p>In August, last year, David Cameron was forced to shelve plans to introduce elected peers after failing to win over Conservative rebels. He proposed<br />
instead that the appointment of peers should be based on the results<br />
of the previous General Election.</p>
<p>Under the scheme the United Kingdom Independent Party would have a total of<br />
24 peers, compared to the three that they have at present.</p>
<p>As voters in previous True blue counties affected by the devastation of the EU ordered HS2 have come to realise, far from being an extremist party, Ukip is true Tory, this discovery influenced the Council elections in May showed clearly the UKIP won directly down the HS2 line starting with Great Missenden. (hardly extremist territory)  the Tory vote share fell from 65% 4 years ago to 37% !</p>

<p>The thing is, even if you don&#8217;t think of them as aprt of a conspiracy, you can see how they result from the kind of minds which are stuck on an ideological path which totally ignores empirical evidence, and which frankly should be rejected by any intellect above that of a ten year old.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not just immigration, everywhere I go I hear people feeling generally annoyed by the petty little restrictions on free speech, how careful you have to be not to offend people (the so called &#8220;Equality Act&#8221; which few people like) and a load of other things. </p>
<p>Somewhere in government or the civil service, people are quietly side stepping democracy by making the changes piecemeal, small enough to slip beneath the radar in the main, until one day you wake up and realise your freedoms have gone and you don&#8217;t recognise your own country.</p>

The same narrow coterie of socialist-minded simpletons, also populate Whitehall and the major organs of The Establishment.</p>
<p>Few are scientists: none biologists, for every act of the above groups has sought to deny the most basic and fundamental of truths: that Darwinism has beaten Marxism throughout the last 4.5 billion years.</p>
<p>Darwinism requires diversity, selection/competition and time to allow for change/evolution.</p>
<p>Marxism requires a single, centrally-imposed solution to every problem: the antithesis to Darwinism.</p>
<p>So, every time the Media conjure up a &#8216;problem case&#8217;, the CORRECT answer is &#8216;Then we must abolish the rules and regulations which created this insanity and allow common-sense and LOCAL decision-making to prevail&#8217;.</p>
