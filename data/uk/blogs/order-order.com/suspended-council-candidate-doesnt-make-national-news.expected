<p>Michael Crick is teasing he has<em>“another astonishing exclusive on UKIP”</em>coming up this evening. You can bet he won’t be giving as much airtime to Labour’s announcement that they have<a href="http://www.getwestlondon.co.uk/news/local-news/harrow-labour-suspend-fraudster-candidate-7041822">suspended</a>one of their council candidates after he was accused of defrauding his own council. Or LibDem councillor Ajit Atwal, who is still a candidate for May despite being<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-derbyshire-26764022">photographed</a>with an AK47.
