<h4>…as Boris attacks the broadcaster for its treatment of David Lowe</h4><p>“It seems that over the weekend, the BBC forced a well-regarded 67-year-old DJ on Radio Devon to resign because he had been so careless as to play a 1932 recording of The Sun Has Got His Hat On. This contained a word that is now unmentionable. It is rude, offensive, and I would never use it; but this word has become so intensely haram that a miasma attaches to anyone using it, even inadvertently; and the prohibition is now enforced with a semi-religious fervour. … So they forced him out. I suppose David Lowe was less valuable to the Corporation than Clarkson, which only makes it worse.” – Boris Johnson,<a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/nigeria/10823670/In-our-own-modest-way-were-living-in-a-Boko-Haram-world.html">Daily Telegraph</a></p>
<h4>Labour accused of covering up the NHS crisis in Wales</h4><p>“Labour has been accused of trying to cover up warnings over high death rates and lengthy waiting times at hospitals in Wales. … An email written by Sir Bruce Keogh, the medical director in England, said mortality rates at six sites were ‘persistently high’ and criticised ‘worrying’ waits for cancer tests. … But it has emerged that officials in the devolved government tried to suppress the message’s release because the information it contained would ‘prejudice the conduct of public affairs’.” –<a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2625828/Labour-bid-cover-health-scandal-Wales-Party-accused-suppressing-email-said-death-rates-six-hospitals-persistently-high.html">Daily Mail</a></p>
<h4>De Piero highlights the gender pay gap</h4><p>“Women who work for themselves earn 58p for every £1 that their male counterparts get, figures reveal today. … Shadow Women’s Minister Gloria De Piero said: ‘More women who are self-employed should be something to cheer. … But the reality is that for too many of them this means lower wages and more insecurity.’” –<a href="http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/politics/5622552/Women-earn-only-58p-for-every-1-earned-by-men-figures-reveal.html">The Sun (£)</a></p>

<h4>John McTernan remembers John Smith, 20 years after his death</h4><p><a href="http://www.conservativehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/John-Smith.jpg"><img src="http://www.conservativehome.com/wp-content/plugins/lazy-load/images/1x1.trans.gif" alt="John smith"/></a>“Would he have been a good prime minister? Certainly. He would have come into No 10 as an experienced cabinet minister who had learned his trade in the difficult days of the Callaghan government. The ethos would have been a very Scottish Christian – Presbyterian, even – socialism, but with that sparkle of wit and humour that Smith gave to everything. Blair and Brown would have shone, but in a different way – Tony as a fine, reforming home or education secretary and Gordon, without the torture of thwarted ambition, more able to use his undoubted talents fully.” – John McTernan,<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/may/12/john-smith-labour-britain-prime-minister">The Guardian</a>“…is the Scottish parliament that we’ve had for the past 15 years, the one that John Smith envisaged?” – Alan Cochrane,<a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/scotland/10823790/Could-John-Smith-have-envisaged-where-his-parliament-would-lead.html">Daily Telegraph</a></p>
<h4>The Left should stand up for individualism, says Owen Jones</h4><p>“There is a long tradition of individualism on the left waiting to be reclaimed. At the beginning of the 20th century, the French socialist leader Jean Jaurès wrote about how capitalism alienated workers from their “very individuality”. Indeed, the individual needs to be defended from more than the state. Poverty strips individuals of their freedom, imposing limitations on every aspect of their lives, from what they can eat to how they spend their leisure time.” – Owen Jones,<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/may/11/state-right-government-individualism-left">The Guardian</a></p>
<h4>Anger at the Guardian’s grim predictions for the North East</h4><p>“The North East last night presented a united front after a national newspaper suggested the region could become the UK’s Detroit. … Across the North East people have reacted angrily to an article in the Guardian newspaper in which the region was described as being ‘on the brink’. … It comes as The Journal prepares to relaunch our popular 100 Reasons Why It’s Great Up North list, celebrating the economic and cultural highlights enjoyed by some 2.5 million people.” –<a href="http://www.thejournal.co.uk/news/north-east-news/outrage-north-east-described-being-7102972">The Journal</a></p>

Mr Farage said: ‘If we asked the 70s and over in this country how they felt about it [homosexuality], most of them still feel uncomfortable.’ … His intervention came as a poll suggested controversy about Ukip’s candidates may be denting the party’s popularity in the run-up to next week’s European Parliament elections.” –<a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2625540/Most-70s-uncomfortable-homosexuality-Farage-claims-defends-views-Ukip-candidate.html">Daily Mail</a></p>

<h4>Pensioners may have to pay £140,000 before the cap on care costs kicks in</h4><p>“Pensioners who require long-term care could end up paying double the much-vaunted cap on costs because there are so many hidden charges, a report claims. … The Coalition has pledged that no one will have to pay their care costs if they spend more than £72,000 – with the state stepping in to foot the bill after that. … But the pledge does not cover the full bill for elderly care.” –<a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2625906/Cap-care-costs-wont-kick-youve-paid-140-000-says-report-claims-just-one-10-state-help.html">Daily Mail</a></p>

Nigeria is a wealthy nation, the world’s 24th-biggest economy, with lucrative deposits of oil. Instead of pumping money into a corrosive political system that fails to deliver decent public services and allows poverty to fester, how about taking steps to stop the crooks in charge from stashing their stolen loot in our banks, our cities and our tax havens?” – Ian Birrell,<a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/what-can-be-done-about-boko-haram-9352442.html">The Independent</a>“To sort out Boko Haram we need the Americans” – David Aaronovitch,<a href="http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/opinion/columnists/article4086865.ece">The Times (£)</a></p>

Prime Minister, welcome to this most British of clubs. I cannot think of a better way for you to escape the cares of high office. … Once you are sitting on top of that throbbing beauty, all those worries about Ukraine, Afghanistan and next year’s General Election will fade to the back of your frazzled mind. … All you will be able to think about is your choice of cutting height and the curse of molehills.” – Quentin Letts,<a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2625867/Ferraris-Jags.html">Daily Mail</a></p>
