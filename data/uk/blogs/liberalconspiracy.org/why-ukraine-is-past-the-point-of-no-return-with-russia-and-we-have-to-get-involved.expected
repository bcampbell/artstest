<p>It feels like the calm before the coming storm. The situation in Ukraine is likely to escalate very quickly, and yet there seems to be worrying lack of urgency about it everywhere.</p>
<p>Three things happened over the last week that have set the stage.</p>
<p><strong>1)</strong> Rather than going home after taking over Crimea, Russia <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/10/satellite-images-russian-military-ukraine-border">started amassing troops</a> on the Ukranian border. It also started directing its people inside Ukraine to take over various towns and cities in the east of the country. There are obvious examples of this: <a href="https://twitter.com/Billbrowder/status/455945850460856320">well-armed and well-trained</a> &#8216;militias&#8217; have sprung up everywhere; the newly appointed police chief in Horlivka <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/15/ukrainian-troops-anti-terrorist-operation-kiev">admitted to being</a> a lieutenant colonel in the Russian army.</p>
<p><strong>2)</strong> In response, Ukraine <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/14/ukraine-deadline-pro-russian-rebels-passes">said it would</a> launch a military operation to take back its own territory unless the militias left peacefully by Monday morning. Fair enough: any government would want to fight back against armed (and foreign) militias who have taken over its towns without any democratic mandate. </p>
<p><strong>3)</strong> The deadline passed and the Ukrainian govt did nothing. Then, it asked <a href="http://time.com/61624/ukraine-united-nations-troops-east/">for UN peacekeeping forces to maintain order</a>. Today, the Ukranian govt belatedly launched military operations, but there are reports that some troops in the east <a href="http://time.com/61971/ukraine-powerless-to-act-as-east-slips-under-russian-control/">are defecting</a> to the pro-Russian side. Meanwhile, the <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/markadomanis/2014/04/15/ukraines-economy-is-nearing-collapse/">Ukranian economy is near collapse</a>.</p>
<p>The key problem here is that Ukraine is too weak against Russia. If Ukraine gets bogged down in a long battle against pro-Russian forces in the east, it would only hasten a collapse of its economy.</p>
<p>Putin is betting that the Ukranian economy collapses before his does, which would trigger a crisis for the EU and force them to agree to his demands.</p>
<p>This is why we have to get involved now rather than later. This could mean all out trade sanctions, UN peacekeeping forces or NATO forces. If Ukraine collapses then Europe will feel the full force and force us to agree to Putin&#8217;s demands. It would be the worst crisis for Nato and the EU in a generation.</p>
<p>Hoping that Russia will back off from strong words is foolish &#8211; Putin&#8217;s only hope now is that Ukraine goes down before him. And he&#8217;s doing his utmost to make that happen.</p>
