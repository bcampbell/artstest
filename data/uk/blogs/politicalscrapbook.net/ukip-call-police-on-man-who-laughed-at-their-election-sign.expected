Officers called on Harry Stephenson at the behest of a local UKIP officials after he <strong>posted a 14-second clip on YouTube</strong>.</p><p>The news comes after a blogger was <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/ukip/10824824/Police-visited-blogger-who-fact-checked-Ukip.html">visited by Cambridgeshire Police</a> <strong>simply for posting fact checks of UKIP policies on Twitter</strong>. Stephenson&#8217;s video shows a picture of the sign with graffiti (which is barely visible) with the following commentary:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;At least someone in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Harwood">Great Harwood</a> has the right idea: &#8220;[Vote UKIP] If you&#8217;re a racist&#8221;. And the best thing is the punctuation&#8217;s right!&#8221;</p></blockquote><p></p><p>The <strong>&#8220;allegation of criminal damage&#8221;</strong> was pursued despite <strong>nothing in the video to indicate that he was responsible</strong> for the graffiti. When contacted by <em>Scrapbook</em>, local &#8216;kippers claimed that &#8220;several&#8221; signs in the area had been vandalised.</p><p><em>Stephenson <a href="http://laughingatukipvideo.blogspot.co.uk/2014/05/the-video-that-earned-me-visit-from-plod.html">claims on his blog</a> that he was &#8220;warned&#8221; not to approach UKIP activists.</em></p></div>
