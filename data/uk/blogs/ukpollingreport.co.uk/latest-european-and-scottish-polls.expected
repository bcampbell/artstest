<p>There have been a couple of new European and Scottish polls over the last couple of days. Europe first, this morning&#8217;s <a href="http://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/document/rmxq05w0hg/YG-Archive-Pol-Sun-results-140514-EU.pdf">YouGov/Sun poll</a> had topline figures of CON 22%, LAB 28%, LDEM 10%, UKIP 25%, GRN 10%. Labour are just ahead of UKIP in first place, the Conservatives remain in third, the Greens and Lib Dems equal for fourth place.</p>
<p>The second was by <a href="http://www.comres.co.uk/polls/C4M_European_Voting_Intention_Poll_15_May_2014.pdf">ComRes</a> who had toplines of CON 22%, LAB 24%, LDEM 8%, UKIP 34%, GRN 5%. Much better figures for UKIP there, with Labour and the Conservatives not far apart for second and the Lib Dems holding fourth place. A lot of this apparent difference is down to how they approach turnout &#8211; YouGov&#8217;s topline figures are based on all respondents, if they took only those certain to vote UKIP would be ahead. ComRes&#8217;s figures include only those 10/10 certain to vote, if they included those who say they are 5/10 or more likely to vote UKIP&#8217;s lead over Labour would be a far more modest 2 points.</p>
<p>Turning to the Scottish polls, there have been two new referendum polls this week, or at least, two newly <i>published</i> Scottish polls. The TNS poll was actually condcted in the last week of April and first couple of days of May. Their topline figures are YES 30%(+1), NO 42%(+1) &#8211; so no change in the lead. Tabs <a href="http://www.tnsglobal.com/sites/default/files/whitepaper/TNSUK_SOM_DataTables2014May14.pdf">here</a>. The second poll is by Survation and much more recent, their topline figures are YES 37%(-1), NO 47%(+1). A minor increase in the NO lead since their last poll, but really it&#8217;s a continuation of a no change trend in Survation&#8217;s Scottish polling: their last five referendum polls have all had figures within 1 point of YES 38%, NO 47%.

<p>Meanwhile tonight&#8217;s YouGov voting intention figures for the Sun are CON 34%, LAB 36%, LD 8%, UKIP 13%</p>
