<div><p>Despite Nick Clegg’s best protestations, it’s often hard to tell exactly what influence, if any, the Lib Dems have had over their Coalition partners these past four years. Well, now we know:<em>they’ve passed on the secrets behind the fabled dodgy Lib Dem bar chart.</em></p>
<p>Ian Austin, the MP for Dudley, this afternoon<a href="https://twitter.com/IanAustinMP/status/465509676877373440">tweeted this offering from his local Conservative Party’s leaflets</a>:</p>
<p><a href="http://labourlist.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/BnXSlafIcAEK5bM.jpg"><img src="http://labourlist.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/BnXSlafIcAEK5bM-500x375.jpg" alt="dodgy tory bar chart dudley"/></a></p>
<p></p>
<p>Even the Lib Dems will be impressed by this frankly spectacular effort. Not only are we fairly sure that 42% is larger than 32%, we’re not entirely convinced that three weeks of canvass returns is the most scientific basis. It is a thing of rare beauty to find something so wonderfully misleading.</p>
<p><em>Just who do Dudley Tories think they’re fooling?</em></p>
